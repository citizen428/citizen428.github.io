<li>&#8220;Digging Deeper&#8221;:http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=5078<br>In a time where it seems like a lot of journalists just seem to copy whatever they find online, it&#8217;s refreshing when a journalist from a small newspaper - who above all is a science and data geek - wins a Pulitzer Price.</li>
<li>&#8220;Guantanamo leaks lift lid on world&#8217;s most controversial prison&#8221;:http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-lift-lid-prison<br>The Guardian covers the Guantanamo leaks, Including a &#8220;video&#8221;:http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-bay-files-reprieve-video interview with Clive Stafford Smith, legal director of Reprieve, as well as an &#8220;interactive presentation&#8221;:http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-guantanamo-bay of all the prisoners&#8217; files.</li>
<li>&#8220;Eating Healthily for $3 a Day&#8221;:http://www.miketuritzin.com/writing/eating-healthily-for-3-a-day/<br>Bad eating habits are quite common in the hacker community, so I decided to include this link. For me the main problem when it comes to healthy eating is having to work, but even there you can manage without too much overhead.</li>
<li>&#8220;Richard Feynman on education in Brazil&#8221;:http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education<br>A good read. During my academic life I met enough people who considered memorizing more important than understanding.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being sick this week I had a lot of time to read, but most if it went into Bruce Sterling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hacker Crackdown&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.mit.edu/hacker/hacker.html">http://www.mit.edu/hacker/hacker.html</a> and Joe Dunthorne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Submarine&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Submarine-Joe-Dunthorne/dp/0241143969.">http://www.amazon.com/Submarine-Joe-Dunthorne/dp/0241143969.</a> Anyway, here we go:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Did &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; become a toy story? &#8220;:http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/08/12/star-wars-was-born-a-long-time-ago-but-not-all-that-far-far-away-in-1972-filmmakers-george-lucas-and-gary-kurtz-wer/<br>I admit to being quite a Star Wars nerd, the &#8220;Han shot first&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_shot_first kind who pretends Episode I-III never happened and who actually sat through the entire &#8220;Holiday special&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Wars_Holiday_Special. If you are remotely like me, this article providing some insider information by &#8220;Gary Kurtz&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kurtz will be quite an interesting read.</li>
<li>&#8220;Computers and Mathematical Notation&#8221;:http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/camn.htm<br>Interesting thoughts on how programming languages (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language">J</a> in this case) could influence mathematical notation by Turing Award winner &#8220;Kenneth E. Iverson&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson</li>
<li>&#8220;Common Programmer Health Problems&#8221;:http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1281257293.html<br>Some sane advice we all occasionally are guilty of ignoring.</li>
<li>&#8220;We Are All Talk Radio Hosts&#8221;:http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/08/we-are-all-talk-radio-hosts/<br>On strawberry jam, reasoning and cognitive bias.</li>
<li>&#8220;The Millennium Development Goal that really does work has been forgotten&#8221;:http://aidwatchers.com/2010/09/the-millennium-development-goal-that-really-does-work-has-been-forgotten/<br>Sure, we&#8217;ll help you. Just not in a way so that you eventually can help yourself.</li>
<li>&#8220;The Anthropology of Hackers&#8221;:http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/09/the-anthropology-of-hackers/63308/<br>Outline of anthropologist Gabriella Coleman&#8217;s course about hacker culture at NYU.</li>
<li>&#8220;Ten things to look for in a circumvention tool&#8221;:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ten-things-look-circumvention-tool<br>By Roger Dingledine of Tor fame.</li>
<li>&#8220;This Ain&#8217;t Your Daddy&#8217;s Wumpus&#8221;:http://nostarch.com/download/Lisp08.pdf<br>Example chapter from the upcoming book &#8220;Land of Lisp&#8221;:http://nostarch.com/lisp.htm (PDF).</li>
<li>&#8220;In Arabian Desert, a Sustainable City Rises&#8221;:http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/arts/design/26masdar.html?_r=1&hp<br>The first residents are starting to move into &#8220;Masdar&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masdar_City, a planned city built in Abu Dhabi. There seems to be some discussion about how much of a &#8220;real&#8221; city Masdar will be, but then Dubai didn&#8217;t feel like a &#8220;real&#8221; place to me either, but more like a soulless agglomeration of skyscrapers and shopping malls.</li>
