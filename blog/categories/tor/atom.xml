    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Update:</em> Server4You rebooted the server into a recovery system for me. I removed the Tor packages and the system is back up again, which means at least the <a href="http://tor.blingblingsquad.net/">mirror</a> is back. I&rsquo;d also like to state explicitly that this whole post is based on a single phone conversation with a Server4You support employee, so it&rsquo;s hard to tell if the company per se really considers Tor to be illegal in Germany. Personally I think it&rsquo;s just a bad excuse for shutting down the service on shared hosts, which is just as bad in my book.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been running a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> relay since sometime in early 2006. There&rsquo;s many good reasons for doing so, but what motivated me personally was my experience of studying in China for one year and having to live with a censored Internet connection myself (theoretically, as there was an <a href="http://embraceubuntu.com/2006/12/08/ssh-tunnel-socks-proxy-forwarding-secure-browsing/">easy way around it</a> if you had a server outside of China to SSH to). Alas our system hasn&rsquo;t been an exit node in a while, but it&rsquo;s still better than nothing.</p>

<p>Today I was contacted by my <a href="http://server4you.de">hosting provider</a>&rsquo;s abuse team, telling me that my server has been shut down because of a ToS violation. I <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/citizen428/status/192189329177718784">immediately was afraid</a> that they might complain about the Tor relay, but still had hope that I might be wrong. Ten hours later, after I got no reply to about five support requests, I decided to call their hotline. The employee first told me that he has no way to see why the abuse team blocked my server, but then said that running a Tor node may have been the reason. What ensued was a five minute conversation full of WTFs, facepalms and headdesks on my part, but the bottom line is that Server4You is of the opinion that it is illegal to run a Tor relay in Germany because of the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerparagraf">&ldquo;Hackerparagraf&rdquo;</a>. If you don&rsquo;t know what that is, <a href="http://hackingexpose.blogspot.com/2012/04/watch-out-white-hats-european-union_3977.html">read up</a> on recent pushes to enforce similar legislation EU wide.</p>

<p>After a fruitless discussion of said law, the — admittely nice — guy on the phone reassured me that my server will be restarted if I agree to disable the Tor node. I politely told him that I have no interest in using their services at all if I can&rsquo;t use them the way I want to, so I&rsquo;ll cancel my contract with Server4You as soon as possible. For the time being I donated some money to Tor, moved my blog over to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (yay <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>) and started evaluating hosting providers in countries with saner legislation (as long as there still are some).</p>

<p>Sure, there&rsquo;s probably a lot of really bad things happening over the Tor network, but those shouldn&rsquo;t be used to discredit the tool&rsquo;s legitimate uses. If we start blaming technology instead of people, we might as well turn off the Internet.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After running a &ldquo;Tor&rdquo;:<a href="http://tor.eff.org">http://tor.eff.org</a> server for more than half a year already and having donated some money to support Tor&rsquo;s development, I was looking for new ways to help out the project. That&rsquo;s why I decided to set up a mirror, which can be reached &ldquo;here&rdquo;:<a href="http://tor.blingblingsquad.net">http://tor.blingblingsquad.net</a> (&ldquo;dist/ mirror&rdquo;:<a href="http://tor.blingblingsquad.net">http://tor.blingblingsquad.net</a>). The initial sync is still running, but the site should be fully functional soon. Once this is finished, I&rsquo;ll also try to set up another mirror on the Vienna based server hosting this domain.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I was pretty busy with personal stuff during the last few days, I hadn&rsquo;t noticed that two days ago German authorities started confiscating &ldquo;Tor&rdquo;:<a href="http://tor.eff.org/">http://tor.eff.org/</a> middleman servers. That changed when earlier today I received an email from the owner of a confiscated system, who wants to get in touch with other Tor admins, in order to start a kind of &ldquo;Knowledge Base&rdquo; for people who were affected by the recent confiscations or who (still) want to set up their own Tor server. Since I&rsquo;m also running &ldquo;such a baby&rdquo;:<a href="http://serifos.eecs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/desc.pl?q=blingblingserver">http://serifos.eecs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/desc.pl?q=blingblingserver</a> (which never was an exit node though) on a virtual server in Germany, I&rsquo;m of course interested in this recent development, so I want to share the informative links provided in his mail with you.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, child pornography is one of the worst crimes I can think of, and I wish the German authorities all the best in finding the people they are after. I do however feel that the route taken here wasn&rsquo;t ideal, as it may well lead to a negative perception of Tor in the general public.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve tripled the total amount of traffic Tor is allowed to serve on my system and &ldquo;donated some money&rdquo;:<a href="http://tor.eff.org/donate.html.en">http://tor.eff.org/donate.html.en</a> to the project. I would advise you to do the same! Besides that I also encourage you to use Tor and promote it to other people, because anonymity is something that can&rsquo;t be gained, only lost.</p>
