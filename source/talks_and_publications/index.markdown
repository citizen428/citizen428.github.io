Publications

* Technical Reviewer for "[Ruby and MongoDB Web Development Beginners Guide](http://www.packtpub.com/ruby-and-mongodb-web-development-beginners-guide/book)":<br> Here's what the author has to say: <em>Big thanks to Michael Kohl, who was of great help in ensuring that every tiny technical detail was accurate and rich in content. I have become "technically mature" because of him!</em>

* [Linux Magazin](http://www.linux-magazin.de/), 3/2005, "Schneller Weg zur Live-CD":<br>While I was still an active developer for Gentoo Linux, I wrote this article on building custom Live CDs with the Catalyst build tool.

* WCM (2002-2006):<br>Dicontinued Austrian IT magazine. I regularly contributed articles on free software and web technologies, but alas none of them seem to be available online in any form.
