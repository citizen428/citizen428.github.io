<li>"Digging Deeper":http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=5078<br>In a time where it seems like a lot of journalists just seem to copy whatever they find online, it's refreshing when a journalist from a small newspaper - who above all is a science and data geek - wins a Pulitzer Price.</li>
<li>"Guantanamo leaks lift lid on world's most controversial prison":http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-lift-lid-prison<br>The Guardian covers the Guantanamo leaks, Including a "video":http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-bay-files-reprieve-video interview with Clive Stafford Smith, legal director of Reprieve, as well as an "interactive presentation":http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-guantanamo-bay of all the prisoners' files.</li>

<li>"Richard Feynman on education in Brazil":http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education<br>A good read. During my academic life I met enough people who considered memorizing more important than understanding.</li>

<li>"LSD: The Geek's Wonder Drug?":http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/01/70015?currentPage=1<br>This article is already 5 years old and I feel we still haven't moved forward in rehabilitating certain drugs and using them for good.</li>
<li>"The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming":http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming.html<br>Another article from 2006, but still as true today as it was back then.</li>
<li>"Programming may one day be about getting the maths right":http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/0429/1224295670955.html?via=mr<br>Yes, I'm an FP aficionado, so what? ;-)</li>
