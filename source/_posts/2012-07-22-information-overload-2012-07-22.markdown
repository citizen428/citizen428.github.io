I was busy last week, so this issue of the Information Overload is very short and a bit late.

* [The laser-powered bionic eye that gives 576-pixel grayscale vision to the blind](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/132918-the-laser-powered-bionic-eye-that-gives-576-pixel-grayscale-vision-to-the-blind)<br>Bionic eyes could change many people's lives.
* [How to avoid getting 'hit by air' in Italy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15987082)<br>I have lived in Italy. I still live with an Italian. I also have an Italian coworker. And I'm quite the hypochondriac myself, so obviously this article resonates well with me.
* [A Small World After All?](http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?aid=2153)<br>Maybe the Internet isn't as globalizing as people believe it to be?
