On nearly every system I use, my ~/.bashrc calls "fortune -se". When I logged in right now I just got the following:

<b>"You will be successful in love."</b>

I won't go into any details, but getting this exact quote today is about as ironic as it gets. Or maybe fortune just has a very strange interpretation of "succesful".
