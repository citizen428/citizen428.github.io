* [Men are less promiscuous when women are scarce](https://royalsociety.org/news/2015/01/men-are-less-promiscuous-when-women-are-scarce/)<br>
Evolutionary speaking, this seems to make sense.
* [Greece shows what can happen when the young revolt against corrupt elites](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/25/greece-shows-what-can-happen-when-young-revolt-against-corrupt-elites)<br>
I wonder if something similar will happen in Spain this year.
* [Indonesia Is About To Start Producing A Male Birth Control Pill That Will Change The World](http://jakarta.coconuts.co/2014/11/24/indonesia-about-start-producing-male-birth-control-pill-going-change-world)<br>
This would be a real game changer for women around the world.

Reading this makes me glad that I managed to see China in the early 2000s.

Escobar certainly left a legacy to Colombia.
* [Human rights groups demand UN action on abuses in Laos](http://asiancorrespondent.com/130098/human-rights-groups-demand-un-action-on-abuses-in-laos/)<br>
Unlike most of its other SE Asian neighbors, nobody seems to talk about Laos much.
* [How Seville transformed itself into the cycling capital of southern Europe](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jan/28/seville-cycling-capital-southern-europe-bike-lanes)<br>
Seville's one of my favorite European cities already, here's one more reason to like it.
* [Spanish Civil War: Rediscovered photos in Navarra museum](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30992883)<br>
Very interesting photos.
* [Auschwitz Survivor Gena Turgel Walked Out of Gas Chamber Alive](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/auschwitz-survivor-gena-turgel-walked-out-gas-chamber-alive-n293496)<br>
Despite the sensationlist headline, it's important we listen to the last Holocaust survivors.
* [7 shocking facts about Saudi Arabia under ‘modernizing’ reign of King Abdullah](http://rt.com/news/226147-seven-facts-king-abdullah/#.VMc9V7o6ULo.facebook)<br>
