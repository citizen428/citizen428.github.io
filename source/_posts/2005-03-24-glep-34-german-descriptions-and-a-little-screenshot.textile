As I think that <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~ciaranm/">ciaranm</a>'s GLEP 34 is a pretty neat idea, I today went ahead and added German longdescriptions to 90+ categories. I'll try to do the remaining categories tomorrow, which shouldn't be to much work as it seems like <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~kugelfang/">Kugelfang</a> is already taking care of the sci- categories.

Besides that nothing special happended, but I've finally uploaded a <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~citizen428/pictures/screenshots/e16_20050322.png">screenshot</a> of my current E16 setup to my dev webspace.
