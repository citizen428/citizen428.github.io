Today when I talked with a non-techy friend from the Midde East on IM, the topic of free speech on the net came up. I then started telling him about "Tor":http://tor.eff.org/overview.html.en and how hidden services could be a solution to this. But when I sent him the links, he couldn't open them, but instead saw the following: 

_We apologize the site you are attempting to visit has been blocked due to its content being inconsistent with the religious, cultural, political and moral values of [insert country here]_. 

I guess it should have been obvious that countries which censor the net wouldn't easily give their citizens the information needed to circumvent this censorship, but still I was pretty baffled by this. 

So please everyone, spread the word about Tor and consider if you want to "volunteer":http://tor.eff.org/volunteer.html.en or "donate":http://tor.eff.org/donate.html.en something to the effort!
