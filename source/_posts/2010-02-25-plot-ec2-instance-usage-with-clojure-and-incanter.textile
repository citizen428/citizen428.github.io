Have you ever wondered which instance types you use most when dealing with Amazon's EC2? I have, so I came up with a short Clojure/<a href="http://incanter.org">Incanter</a> program to plot a nice chart like this:

<a href="http://twitpic.com/15byfe" title="EC2 usage plotted by incanter">(full size image)</a>

Here's the code, if you have any feedback please leave a comment, this was the first time I used Incanter.
