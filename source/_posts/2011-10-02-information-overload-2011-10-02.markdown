* [Höfische Gesellschaft 2.0](http://www.zeit.de/2009/44/Gesellschaft-Soziale-Netzwerke/komplettansicht)<br>How social media resembles imperial courts (in German).
* [The concentration camp](http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2011-08-25-overy-en.html)<br>Very long and detailed article on one of humanity's darkest sides.
* [Princeton bans academics from handing all copyright to journal publishers](http://theconversation.edu.au/princeton-bans-academics-from-handing-all-copyright-to-journal-publishers-3596)<br>It's always good to see major institutions taking a step in the right direction.
* [Ex-F.B.I. Agent Cites High-Level Dysfunction Over 9/11](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/us/12agent.html?_r=1)<br>A former CIA agent published a behind the scenes book on the "War On Terror".
* [Top 20 Games Nintendo Wouldn’t Release In The US](http://www.crit-hit.net/top-20-games-nintendo-wouldnt-release-in-the-us/)<br>I don't play much anymore, but as a former console collector I know how frustrating this is (and I won't even mention all the cool stuff that never made it to Europe).
* ["Algorithm" is Not a Four-Letter Word](http://www.jamisbuck.org/presentations/rubyconf2011/index.html)<br>You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
* [What’s contained in a boarding pass barcode?](http://shaun.net/2011/05/whats-contained-in-a-boarding-pass-barcode/)<br>If you know me and this blog post series, you know that this is the type of stuff I like.

* [How Porsche hacked the financial system and made a killing](http://radian.org/notebook/porsche)<br>This article from 2009 shows very well why it's called "playing the stock market".
* [Single dose of hallucinogen may create lasting personality change](http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-09-dose-hallucinogen-personality.html)<br>What the headline doesn't say, is that's it's a rather positive change. Anyway, every bit of serious drug research is a step in the right direction.
