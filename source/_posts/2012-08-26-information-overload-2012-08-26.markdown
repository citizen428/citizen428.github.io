Remember how I said there probably won't be an Information Overload this week? Turns out I was wrong :-)

* [Burma ends advance press censorship](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/20/burma-ends-advance-press-censorship)<br>This seems like a step in the right direction, let's hope it stays this way.
* [IMF Says Bailouts Iceland-Style Hold Lessons in Crisis Times](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-12/imf-says-bailouts-iceland-style-hold-lessons-for-crisis-nations)<br>How Icenland recovered the economic crisis.
* [India’s SMS Hoax Panic: Could It Happen In The U.S.?](http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/23/indias-sms-hoax-panic-could-it-happen-in-the-u-s/)<br>With the ubiquity of social media and text messages, this should be fairly easy to replicate anywhere.
* [Keep in mind as you put together your Neil Armstrong packages tonight…](http://apple.copydesk.org/2012/08/25/keep-in-mind-as-you-put-together-your-neil-armstrong-packages-tonight/)<br>RIP Neil Armstrong!

* [Your Scientific Reasoning Is More Flawed Than You Think](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=your-scientific-reasoning-more-flawed-than-you-think)<br>Even scientifically minded peopel fall back to childhood ideas about how the world works.
* [How Long Do You Want to Live?](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/sunday-review/how-long-do-you-want-to-live.html)<br>An interesting question to pose in light of ever-increasing life expectancy.
