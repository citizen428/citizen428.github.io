Since I started my new job this January, I more or less stopped doing any sports, which had the usual consequences of fitness--&nbsp;&& weight++. I've wanted to change this for quite a while now and since my local "Taekwondo school":http://www.taekwondo-twin-center.at/home.php?ttc_schule_id=8 - which by the way is conviniently located half-way between my apartment and the office - currently has a special offer (two private introductory lessons plus the "dobok":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobok for 25 Euro) I decided to give it a go. The first intro lesson today was pretty cool and the second will be this Wednesday. After this I'll get my white belt and will formally start training in the beginner's class. 

<b>Update:</b>
Had my second private lesson on Wednesday and really liked it too, so I signed up for the school and will try to train 2-3 times a week from now on. Since there are 13(!) training sessions per week I can choose from, I should be able to squeeze them in even in rather busy weeks.
