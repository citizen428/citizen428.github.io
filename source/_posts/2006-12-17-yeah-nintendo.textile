A few days ago I've blogged about me being uncertain whether to get myself a Nintento Wii or an Xbox 360 (please don't tell me to get both, that thought is too tempting already!). Currently Big N's latest offering is a slight favorite again, since - after an exhausting few days partying - I spent the late afternoon and early evening playing "Paper Mario: The Thounsand-Year Door":http://cube.ign.com/articles/556/556422p1.html, which is one of the most entertaining and funny games I've ever played. Later on I decided to finally try out the "Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection":http://www.nintendowifi.com/ with Mario Kart DS (friend code: 197655187733), and I have to say that I just love it, which means that now I really have to get myself a copy of "Metroid Prime Hunters":http://ds.ign.com/articles/697/697307p1.html as soon as possible.
