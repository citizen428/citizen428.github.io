Since too many of life's pleasures are demonized by all the greyfaces out there, I've decided to start a new series called "In defense of", where I'll collect quotes, song lyrics, etc. which show them in a different - and maybe more positive - way.

<i>*Kikizo:* So, how many drinks does it take for ideas to stop being feasible, good ideas, and start being just complete nonsense? 

*Itagaki:* Haha! It's hard to say, because I am drinking pretty much full-time. Of course, there are ups and downs, waves, of how I drink in terms of the amount, but it's a long period of time. In the last ten years - not that you asked this question - I think I had better ideas when I was drinking whisky. When I am drinking shochu, that's a conservative drink, so the ideas are not that great. Beer is just like water to me, so it just helps me and everyone else loosen up a little bit, it doesn't really contribute to coming up with ideas.</i> (found on "Ars Technica":http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2006/7/4/4522)

*BOUNCING SOULS*
<i>"I Started Drinking Again"

Since I started drinkin' again 
Since I started drinkin' again 
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you 
Since I started drinkin' again 

I know that the neighbors are all a-talkin' 
They swear that I have lost my mind 
Ah, but they do not know 
That I've just gained control 
Of all the heartache that you left behind 

[Chorus:]
Since I started drinkin' again 
Since I started drinkin' again 
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you 
Since I started drinkin' again 

Well I know that the boss is gonna fire me 
When I stumble in late to work again 
But surprise will replace that old scowl on his face 
When he sees that I do not give a damn 

[Chorus:]
Since I started drinkin' again 
Since I started drinkin' again 
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you 
Since I started drinkin' again 

I ain't shed one lousy tear over you 
Since I started drinkin' 
Since I started drinkin' 
Since I started drinkin' again
