As we all know posting code to "Moodle":http://moodle.org/ (the software that powers "RubyLearning":http://rubylearning.org) can be a bit cumbersome. I therefore created a TextMate command which will

<ul>
<li> take the currently active file</li>
<li> replace all occurrences of < with the HTML-entity</li>
<li> wrap all of that in [code ruby] tags and</li>
<li> copy it to the clipboard, ready to be pasted into the forums.</li>
</ul>
