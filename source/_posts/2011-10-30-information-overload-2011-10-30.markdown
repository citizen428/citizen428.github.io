{% blockquote Albert Einstein http://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism Why Socialism? %}
The individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society. But he does not experience this dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie, as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights, or even to his economic existence.

* [Security Flaw Links BitTorrent Users to Skype Accounts](http://torrentfreak.com/security-flaw-links-bittorrent-users-to-skype-accounts-111020/)<br/>I never was a big Skype fan in the first place, but it's articles like this one that make me even more wary about using the service.
* [This economic collapse is a 'crisis of bigness'](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/sep/25/crisis-bigness-leopold-kohr)<br/>Nice intro to the writings of [Leopold Kohr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Kohr) who already predicted the collapse of growth-driven systems in the 1950s.

* [Why Socialism?](http://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism)<br/>One of Albert Einstein's most well-known political works, which in some regards still seems pretty up to date, despite being written in 1949.
* [The Chilling Story of Genius in a Land of Chronic Unemployment](http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/15/the-chilling-story-of-genius-in-a-land-of-chronic-unemployment/)<br/>A somewhat older article, that may give you a different perspective on the spammers and scammers commonly associated with Nigeria.
* [The Lairds of Learning](http://www.monbiot.com/2011/08/29/the-lairds-of-learning/)<br/>I posted some articles on academic publishing lately, this is another one.
* [Katholische Kirche macht mit Pornos ein Vermögen](http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article13679586/Katholische-Kirche-macht-mit-Pornos-ein-Vermoegen.html)<br/>The Catholic Church in Germany owns one of the country's largest publishing houses, which also sells a lot of pornographic literature and other things that her followers don't approve of. But when people complain, the usually get ignored (in German, [short summary in English](http://www.worldcrunch.com/catholic-church-makes-fortune-german-porn-business/3995)).

Sometimes the hardest thing about committing the perfect crime can be keeping your genius to yourself.
