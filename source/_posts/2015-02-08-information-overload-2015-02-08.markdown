* [Life in Prisons in Southeast Asia is far removed from the West](http://www.inseasia.com/2015/02/life-in-prisons-southeast-asia-is-far-removed-west/)<br>
No news here, but may be interesting for people not aware of the situation in SE Asian prisons.
* [Don’t Call them Expats, They are Immigrants like Everyone Else](http://www.siliconafrica.com/dont-call-them-expats-they-are-immigrants-like-everyone-else/)<br>
For me: expat = sent abroad by company, getting bonuses etc. for working abroad. Everyone else, myself included, is a foreign worker/migrant. In a discussion on Facebook however someone mentioned the following, which strikes me as true: moving from richer to poorer country = expat. Moving from poorer to richer country = migrant.
* [Yes, Oil Is Behind a Lot of Wars](http://www.psmag.com/politics-and-law/oil-behind-civil-war-intervention)<br>
Also interesting in this context: [Greed versus Grievance](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Greed_versus_grievance)
* [India: The Austria-Hungary of the 21st Century?](http://thediplomat.com/2015/01/india-the-austria-hungary-of-the-21st-century/)<br>
You don't see Austria and India compared all that often. Th comparison seems rather far-fetched though.
* [Sea Slug has Taken Genes from the Algae it Eats, Allowing it to Photosynthesize Like a Plant, Study Reports](http://blog.mbl.edu/?p=3285)<br>
This is really fascinating, but [is it true](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23645554)?
* [Top China analyst: Beijing has been duping the US since Mao](http://www.businessinsider.com/top-china-analyst-beijing-has-been-duping-the-us-since-mao-2015-2)<br>
Now I'm not one to underestimate the Chinese, but this does sound a bit paranoid.
* [The World’s Email Encryption Software Relies on One Guy, Who is Going Broke](http://www.propublica.org/article/the-worlds-email-encryption-software-relies-on-one-guy-who-is-going-broke)<br>
Luckily this article seems to have greatly improved things for Werner Koch.
* [What are Europeans afraid of most?](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/europe-europeans-fears-terrorism-unemployment-pandemics)<br>
"A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp." — George Orwell, 1984
* [Parton sends books to Rotherham](http://somefactsare.blogspot.com/2014/05/parton-sends-books-to-rotherham.html)<br>
Let's finish on a positive note...
