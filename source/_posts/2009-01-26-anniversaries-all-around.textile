What a weekend for celebrations! On Saturday this blog turned 4 ("first post":http://citizen428.net/archives/1-Blog-started.html, <a href="http://citizen428.net/archives/3-Added-RedCloth.html">first "real" post</a>), on Sunday it's been exactly one year since I left Austria (although I did go back for 6 days around Christmas) and today is "Australia Day":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day. I had a great weekend and the weather actually was nice for a change. Sunshine and lollipops all around... ;)
