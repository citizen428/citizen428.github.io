I just noticed that I haven't blogged much lately, so the least I can do is put together one of my random link dumps for you:

*Tech Stuff:*
<ul>
<li>"FLPR":http://flpr.org/: 
Sure, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) has proven itself to be a pretty neat platform for web development. However, there are people who disagree with one or more of the choices implied by the acronym, and yours truly is one of them. If you want to learn a little more about alternative technologies head over to FLPR to read up on web development with FreeBSD, lighttpd, PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails.</li>

<li>"Speaking the Lingo":http://onestepback.org/articles/lingo/index.html: 
A nice presentation on creating "domain specific languages":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Specific_Language with Ruby</li>

<li>"Why Good Programmer's Are Lazy and Dumb":http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-08-24-n14.html: 
Ok, almost everybody already knows that good programmers exactly know when to be lazy and dumb, but the article is still a good read for poor folks like me who are lazy and dumb without being overly good programmers...</li>
</ul>

*Fun:*
<ul>
<li>"Semapedia":http://semapedia.org/: 
Hyperlinking Wikipedia articles in meatspace is what this cool project is doing. Interesting stuff, as soon as time permits I'll have to play around with this a little more!</li>

<li>"What's My Pirate Name?":http://www.fidius.org/quiz/pirate/:
Everyone should have his own pirate name...</li>

<li>"ColdPizza":http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060104161112858: 
A nice parody of Coldplay's recent "DRM-EULA":http://itch.in/journal/bad-bad-coldplay.
</li>
</ul>
