Due to an extended weekend trip this issue of "Information Overload" is much shorter and a bit later than usual, the next one should be back to normal:

<ul>
<li>"Who Killed Prolog":http://vanemden.wordpress.com/2010/08/21/who-killed-prolog/<br>Interesting read for programming language nerds, also contains interesting info on how the Japanese economy was feared by the US in the 80ies.</li>

<li>"Obama ist nur ein normaler, gemaessigter Demokrat im Stil von Bill Clinton":http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/32/32381/1.html<br>Interview with Noam Chomsky in German.</li>
</ul>
