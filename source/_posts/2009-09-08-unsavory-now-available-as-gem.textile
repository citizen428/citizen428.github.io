<a href="http://github.com/citizen428/unsavory/tree/master">unsavory</a> is now available as a gem, which means that you can comfortably install it like this:
{% codeblock %}
$ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com 
$ sudo gem install citizen428-unsavory
{% endcodeblock %}
Rubygems will automatically create a wrapper-script named "unsavory", which you can use to start the program so you finally can get rid of all these outdated bookmarks.
