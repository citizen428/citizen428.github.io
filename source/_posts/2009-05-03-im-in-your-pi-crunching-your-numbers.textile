From "Ruby Quiz #202":http://rubyquiz.strd6.com/quizzes/202:

_And sometimes the fastest code is the code you don't write. Michael Kohl's solution:_

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
require 'rubygems'
require 'hpricot'
require 'open-uri'
doc = Hpricot(open('http://www.eveandersson.com/pi/digits/100000'))
puts (doc/'pre').inner_html
{% endcodeblock %}

_It finishes in less than one second for the entire 100,000 digits!_

And no, this wasn't a serious submission... :-)
