Just a quick summary of the talks I saw on day 1 (powered by [Flora Power](http://www.flora-power.de/), since I already started this year's congress with a lack of sleep).

* [Marriage From Hell](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4897.en.html)<br/> Authoritarian governments using surveillance technologies provided by Western companies is not exactly news. Not a bad talk, although it was a bit from the "No shit, Sherlock" department. Not worthy of a keynote in my opinion.
* [The Atari 2006 Video Computer System](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4711.en.html)<br/>Since I love hearing about old hardware and its limitations, this was an awesome talk. The speaker definitely knew what he was talking about and the presentation was very solid.
* [Can trains be hacked?](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4799.en.html)<br/>Another good talk, but understandably there was no information on actually hacking the train system. If you want more info on this topic, listen to [Chaos Radio Express #171](http://cre.fm/cre171) from December last year.
* [SCADA and PLC Vulnerabilities in Correctional Facilities](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4661.en.html)<br/>Since I wanted to charge my notebook, I watched this one as a stream. This of course led to web surfing and IRC, so I didn't pay as much attention as this talk would have deserved.
* [Almighty DNA?](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4913.en.html)<br/>Why collecting DNA is also a form of data retention. If you've been to similar talks before you probable knew most of the stories they told, if not the video and [Chaos Radio Express #143](http://cre.fm/cre143) should be good resources to catch up.
* [What is in a name?](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4713.en.html)<br/>The history of names and identity regimes from 1500 until today. Pretty interesting, but unfortunately I was in a bit of a post-dinner food coma.
* [Defending mobile phones](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4736.en.html)<br/>This talk was really full and unfortunately the stream didn't work either, so I ended up watching the second half of  [Macro dragnets: Why trawl the river when you can do the whole ocean](Macro dragnets: Why trawl the river when you can do the whole ocean) which had some interesting info on avoiding face recognition and other things.<br/>
* [String Oriented Programming](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4817.en.html)<br/>A talk about evading ASLR, DEP and other security measures with `printf` exploits.
