Lately a lot of my working time is spent on cloud technologies, most notably the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>. In recent month I compiled a rather comprehensive list of cloud-related links which I now decided to share with you all.

<a href="http://gist.github.com/314445">Cloud Links</a>

It's just a markdown file copied into a Gist, so if you want to add any links just fork away! :-)
