After a mostly sleepless bus journey and "some" waiting, we've finally made it to the already quite busy "Hackcenter":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Hackcenter, where we met a few people we know from previous years. About half an hour ago the queue at the ticket counter was way too long, so we're trying our luck a little later. Since we're getting up quite early tomorrow (around 9am) to see the "keynote":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1256.en.html, I'll try to catch a few more hours of sleep tonight.
