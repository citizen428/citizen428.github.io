I was rather busy this week, so this Information Overload is super short.

* [Condition Handling for Non-Lispers](http://lubutu.com/soso/condition-handling-for-non-lispers)<br>If you ever need to explain condition handling to a non-Lisper, this is a sensible post to point them too.
* [IWF-Forscher spielen radikale Bankreform durch](http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/oekonomie/nachrichten/vollgeld-iwf-forscher-spielen-radikale-bankreform-durch-seite-all/7008170-all.html)<br>Two IMF economist test a model where banks can't create new money in the form of loans (in German).
* [Prehistoric human brain found pickled in bog](http://news.discovery.com/history/preserved-brain-bog-england-110406.html)<br>A bit older, but still very insteresting for science.
