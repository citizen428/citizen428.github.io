{% blockquote Piotr Czerski (translated by Marta Szreder) http://pastebin.com/0xXV8k7k We, the Web Kids %}
To us, the Web is a sort of shared external memory. We do not have to remember unnecessary details: dates, sums, formulas, clauses, street names, detailed definitions. It is enough for us to have an abstract, the essence that is needed to process the information and relate it to others.
{% endblockquote %}

* [We, the Web Kids](http://pastebin.com/0xXV8k7k)<br>While I'm probably a bit too old to qualify as a "web kid", I agree with most of this post.
* [The Unfinished](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/09/090309fa_fact_max?currentPage=all)<br>This very long article on David Foster Wallace is not only interesting, but also serves as a reminder to myself to finally read [Infinite Jest](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316066524/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=citizen4blog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316066524) (affiliate link).
* [Life With and Without Animated Ducks: The Future Is Gender Distributed](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/02/life-with-and-without-animated.html)<br>Sexism shows in many ways, I hadn't really considered this angle before.
* [Craig Silverstein, Google's first employee](http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_16291970)<br>An interview with Google's first employee. This is a bit older, but still interesting.
* [Why Do Some People Learn Faster?](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/10/why-do-some-people-learn-faster-2/)<br>Articles about the brain and/or learning make a regular appearance in this blog series, here we go for another one.
* [Don’t hate the player: How fun and games can encourage sustainable choices](http://grist.org/living/dont-hate-the-player-how-fun-and-games-can-encourage-sustainable-choices/)<br>I like the example encouragements shown in this article.
* [Essen 2032: Da sagt der Kühlschrank etwas anderes ](http://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/2012-02/geboren-2012-ernaehrung)<br>One thing I like about articles trying to predict the future is imagining how naive they will look later (in German).
* [BitTorrent Live: Cheap, Real-Time P2P Video Streaming That Will Kill TV](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/13/bittorrent-live/)<br>In case you missed this last week.
* [Leonard Cohen — Beautiful Loser](http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/leonard_cohen-beautiful_loser)<br>A timeline of Leonard Cohen's life.
* [What Happens to the Coke in Coca-Cola?](http://www.good.is/post/regulators-mount-up-what-happens-to-the-coke-in-coca-cola/)<br>Coca-Cola is still made with coca leaves, but happens to the cocaine in them? Read this article to find out.

The future is not evenly distributed. Not along cultural lines, along language lines, along political, economic, class, or generational lines. And most certainly not along gender lines.
