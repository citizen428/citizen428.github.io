* [No, Mornings Don’t Make You Moral](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/moral-mornings)<br>
Luckily my job allows me to at least somewhat live my night owl tendencies.
* [No one could see the color blue until modern times](http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-is-blue-and-how-do-we-see-color-2015-2)<br>
While the title is borderline click bait, the actual article is very interesting.
* [Pepe Mujica: "Vielleicht bin ich ein wenig Anarchist"](http://derstandard.at/2000012314398/Pepe-Mujica-Vielleicht-bin-ich-ein-wenig-Anarchist)<br>
Nice interview (in German).
* [GPG And Me](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/gpg-and-me/)<br>
While the actual blog post is a bit weak, the comments have some good discussions.
* [Araújo’s Vision for East Timor](http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/araujos-vision-for-east-timor/)<br>
Sometimes you also have to talk about the "forgotten" countries.
* [Brazil releases 'good' mosquitoes to fight dengue fever](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-29356232)<br>
This sounds like it could be a major step in the fight against dengue!
* [The Punisher's Paradise](http://sea-globe.com/davao-philippines-tom-sykes-duterte-southeast-asia-globe/)<br>
"The state calls its own violence law, but that of the individual, crime." — Max Stirner.
* [“I found myself turning into an idiot!”: David Graeber explains the life-sapping reality of bureaucratic life](http://www.salon.com/2015/03/05/i_found_myself_turning_into_an_idiot_david_graeber_explains_the_life_sapping_reality_of_bureaucratic_life/)<br>
Interesting interview.
* [In the End, People May Really Just Want to Date Themselves](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/in-the-end-people-may-really-just-want-to-date-themselves/)<br>
At least according to statistics done with data from various popular online dating sites.
* [Exclusive: Lost City Discovered in the Honduran Rain Forest](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/03/150302-honduras-lost-city-monkey-god-maya-ancient-archaeology/)<br>
There may be remnats of a whole lost civilization, but they are threatened by greed.
