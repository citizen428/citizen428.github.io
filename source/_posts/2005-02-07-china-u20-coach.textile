Ok, I know "Hattrick":http://www.hattrick.org is only a game. But one I've played constantly for more than 25 month now and which has more than 500.000 users wold wide. Therefore I really get a kick out of being elected new national team coach for the Chinese U20, with approximately a third of all votes going to me!

I know this means that I will spend even more time on the site than I already do, but that's ok, at least for me... ;)
