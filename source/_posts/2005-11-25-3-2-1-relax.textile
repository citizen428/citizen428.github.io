Remember the band "Frankie Goes To Hollywood":http://www.fgth.org.uk/? That's good, but actually they have nothing to do with this blog entry, except for one thing: they've once recorded a song called "Relax" and that's what I finally managed to do today! :)

After feeling pretty burned out recently, my girlfriend and me decided to spend an evening at the "spa":http://oberlaa.at/. We haven't done this for ages, but it was exactly what I needed to get my head free again. When we arrived there I thought I'm going to mostly swim lanes, but then I decided that I do enough of those at my weekly waterpolo training... That's why in the end we opted for a wellness program, including water massage, sauna and other nice things.

To make a long story short: I'm really relaxed and feel more motivated again, so the whole thing really was worth the 10 Euro it cost me.
