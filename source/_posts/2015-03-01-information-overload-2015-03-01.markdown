* [The best idea to redevelop Dharavi slum? Scrap the plans and start again](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/feb/18/best-ideas-redevelop-dharavi-slum-developers-india)<br>
When visiting Dharavi in 2008 I was blown away. Certainly not what I expected from a slum.
* [Modernization Theory and Uncritical Histories: A Review of South Korea’s Rise](http://thediplomat.com/2015/02/modernization-theory-and-uncritical-histories-a-review-of-south-koreas-rise/)<br>

* [Ancient Civilizations Held The Key To Gotham’s Growth](http://www.vocativ.com/culture/science/aztecs-werent-different-average-new-yorker/)<br>

Great photos!
* [The disappeared: Chicago police detain Americans at abuse-laden 'black site'](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site)<br>
No matter where they are, "black sites" should not be part of any law enforcement apparatus. 
* [Visualizing Hold'em Hands](http://chrisbeaumont.org/holdem_odds/)<br>
Poker and visualizations in one post, I basically had to include this.
* [Antiwork – a radical shift in how we view “jobs”](https://contributoria.com/issue/2014-12/543d1c2487628e9a6500001b)<br>
I always was of the opinion that work is overrated.
