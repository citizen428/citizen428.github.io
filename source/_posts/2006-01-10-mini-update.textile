Yesterday evening "m3's":http://www.leyrer.priv.at/martin/ girlfriend "Susanne":http://www.webcave.at/ organized a little surprise dinner at "mas":http://www.pancho.at/mas/index.htm to celebrate Martin's 35th birthday, which was really relaxing and entertaing. :) It was just what I needed after a rather unnerving day at university, and it really made me look forward to my other "social events" this week (the monthly "AGLUG":http://www.aglug.net/ meeting on Thursday and another "Pardus":http://pardus.at/ meetup on Saturday).

Today was my second day in my new job, which I mostly spent on heartbeat scripts and a "funny" server which shows some irritating behavior. I also had to build my first deb package for the deployment of some in-house software, and I have to say that I now love Portage more than ever... ;)
