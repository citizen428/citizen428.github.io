* [Why Does Time Fly as We Get Older?](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/2013/12/18/why-does-time-fly-as-we-get-older/)<br>
In case you wonder, here are five different theories.
* [Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Protesters Clash With Police In Surreal Scenes](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/09/28/hong-kong-pro-democracy-protests_n_5896408.html)<br>
Sometimes a picture really does say more than a thousand words.
* [China is Hong Kong’s future – not its enemy](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/30/china-hong-kong-future-protesters-cry-democracy)<br>
I like differing points of view, here's one on the current situation in Hong Kong.
* ["Es ist schlimmer als das Töten"](http://www.zeitjung.de/menschen/11321-es-ist-schlimmer-als-das-toeten-interview-mit-ann-christine-woehrl/)<br>
About acid attacks on women. While the interview is in German, the photos have no language.
* [What It’s like to Fly the $23,000 Singapore Airlines Suites Class](https://medium.com/travel-adventure/what-its-like-to-fly-the-23-000-singapore-airlines-suites-class-17d9f3fee0d)<br>
Now that's traveling in style.
* [Coming up easy](http://sea-globe.com/coming-up-easy-kratom-thailand-southeast-asia-globe/)<br>
Like with many other drugs, people can't seem to make up their mind about kratom either. Curse or blessing?
* [8 Lessons Learned from Visiting Every Country in the World](http://www.fluentin3months.com/8-lessons-learned-from-visiting-every-country-in-the-world)<br>
I'm a sucker for all things travel related.
* ['In 1976 I discovered Ebola, now I fear an unimaginable tragedy'](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/04/ebola-zaire-peter-piot-outbreak)<br>
Despite the sensationalist title, this is actually a very interesting interview with the researcher who discovered Ebola.
* [Thailand’s Full-Moon Parties Have Become a Trashy Disgrace](http://world.time.com/2013/07/08/thailands-full-moon-parties-have-become-a-trashy-disgrace/)<br>
Never went, don't plan on ever going. Here's why.
* [What Europe Would Look Like If All the Separatist Movements Got Their Way](http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2014/09/18/map_what_europe_would_look_like_if_all_the_separatist_movements_got_their.html)<br>
I for one would be happy to truly have a Europe of regions instead of countries.
