<li>Get intrigued by the low prices of the Intel based Mac Minis and use them as an excuse to finally buy your first Mac.</li>
<li>While on holidays in Hong Kong (or any place else without a VAT), get yourself a black 8GB iPod Nano to go along with the Mini. Again, use the comparatively cheap price as an excuse.</li>
<li>When your boss offers you a bonus, insist on getting payed in hardware and choose a black MacBook.</li>
</ol>

Been there, done that, loving it! ;)
