{% blockquote Maddox http://maddox.xmission.com/ I hope SOPA passes %}
We defeat SOPA today, only to face it again tomorrow. It's like trying to stop a cold by blowing your nose. It's time we go after the virus.
{% endblockquote %}

* [Blue cabinet](https://werebuild.eu/wiki/Blue_cabinet)<br/>A project that wants "to name, shame and expose those who profit on selling the surveillance equipment that enables the intimidation, harassment and killing of innocent people".
* [Making Love To WebKit](http://acko.net/blog/making-love-to-webkit/)<br/>[Acko.net](http://acko.net) always had awesome design, but his newest one is absolutely mindblowing.
* [said the pot to the kettle](http://www.tangledwilderness.org/pdfs/saidthepottothekettle-web.pdf)<br/>This PDf subtitled "feminist theory for anarchist men" is a good read for everyone who's interested in overcoming antiquated gender stereotypes, be they male or female.
* [I hope SOPA passes](http://maddox.xmission.com/)<br/>Typical Maddox style.
* [Behavioral economics and facebook conspiracy theories](http://jeffdechambeau.com/friending-fast-and-slow.html)<br/>While the author talks about a conspiracy theory, I think it's fair to assume that the big web companies do use behavioral psychology when trying to get us to click on ads.
* [An Iran war is brewing from mutual ignorance and chronic miscalculation](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/20/iran-war-brewing-simon-tisdall)<br/>I still have the naive hope that war is evitable.
* [US-Copyright-Cops greifen weltweit zu](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/0,1518,773495,00.html)<br/>If you have German speaking friends who you want to educate about SOPA/PIPA, point them to this article by "Der Spiegel".
* [Paredit - emacs minor mode](http://prezi.com/2lanmqb0nnkj/paredit-emacs-minor-mode/)<br/>A neat presentation on Paredit, a great Emacs minor mode for Lisp hackers.
* [In Which I Fix My Girlfriend’s Grandparents’ WIFI And Am Hailed As A Conquering Hero.](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/in-which-i-fix-my-girlfriends-grandparents-wifi-and-am-hailed-as-a-conquering-hero)<br/>We've all been there, but this is brilliantly told.
* [People Are Awesome: The Coffee Shop Where Everyone Pays for Everyone Else's Drinks](http://www.good.is/post/people-are-awesome-the-south-carolina-coffee-shop-where-everyone-pays-for-everyone-else-s-drinks)<br/>It's not often enough that I get to post something nice here.
