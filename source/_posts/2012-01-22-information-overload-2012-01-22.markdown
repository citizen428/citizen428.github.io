* [US-Copyright-Cops greifen weltweit zu](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/0,1518,773495,00.html)<br>If you have German speaking friends who you want to educate about SOPA/PIPA, point them to this article by "Der Spiegel".
* [Paredit - emacs minor mode](http://prezi.com/2lanmqb0nnkj/paredit-emacs-minor-mode/)<br>A neat presentation on Paredit, a great Emacs minor mode for Lisp hackers.

* [People Are Awesome: The Coffee Shop Where Everyone Pays for Everyone Else's Drinks](http://www.good.is/post/people-are-awesome-the-south-carolina-coffee-shop-where-everyone-pays-for-everyone-else-s-drinks)<br>It's not often enough that I get to post something nice here.
