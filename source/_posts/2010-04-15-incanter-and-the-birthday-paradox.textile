As a little follow-up to <a href="http://citizen428.net/archives/423-The-Birthday-Paradox-in-Clojure.html">my recent post on the Birthday Paradox</a> I decided to clean up the code and also plot the relationship between group size and the probability of a shared birthday with <a href="http://incanter.org/">Incanter</a> (mostly because I wanted to show off 1.2&#8217;s <a href="http://data-sorcery.org/2010/04/04/new-chart-theme/">hot new default theme</a>).

Code:

I just love how easy it is to explore problems like this with Clojure and then use Incanter go get some cute little plot too! :-)

<b>Update</b>: Incanter's author David Liebke sent me <a href="http://twitter.com/liebke/status/12242784190">a version of the above that fits into one tweet</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/6aa65685559cdb5b6e5e">another one with a Latex annotation</a>! I updated my code to incorporate some of his suggestions.
