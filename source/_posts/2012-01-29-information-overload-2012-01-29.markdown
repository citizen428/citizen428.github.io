* [Die, Hollywood, die!](http://benwerd.com/blog/2012/01/22/die-hollywood-die/)<br>A voice of reason in the ["Kill Hollywood"](http://ycombinator.com/rfs9.html) discussion.
* [The New French Hacker-Artist Underground](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/01/ff_ux/all/1)<br>The French group UX sneaks into places to restore them (or the art inside them). A fascinating read.
* [Die Opfer von Niklaas und Perrine](http://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/kultur/medien/?em_cnt=427905)<br>Granted, this article makes most sense if you were born in the 1970s (or early 1980s) and grew up in Austria, but I still wanted to include it here (in German).
* [A tale of new censors - Vodafone UK, T-Mobile UK, O2 UK, and T-Mobile USA](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tale-new-censors-vodafone-uk-t-mobile-uk-o2-uk-and-t-mobile-usa)<br>If you think only China and dictatorships in the Middle East censor the internet, think again.
* [Public speaking for normal people](http://www.humbledmba.com/public-speaking-for-normal-people)<br>Public speaking is a difficult topic for me. I like doing it, but tend to be rather nervous. Once I'm done I always feel like my talks were horrible, but feedback usually suggests they weren't. This post has some interesting ideas which I'm eager to try out.
* [An Investment Manager's View on the Top 1%](http://whorulesamerica.net/power/investment_manager.html)<br>Seems like the "Occupy" movement should have adopted we are the 99.9% as a slogan.
* [Information Security Interview Questions](http://danielmiessler.com/study/infosec_interview_questions/)<br>If you want to get into information security, you should read this article for a little self assessment.
* [Mega-man: The fast, fabulous, fraudulent life of Megaupload's Kim Dotcom](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/mega-man-the-bizarre-rise-and-sudden-downfall-of-kim-dotcom.ars/1)<br>Interesting portrait of [Kim Dotcom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Dotcom), the man who's all over the news again.
* [Understanding the bin, sbin, usr/bin , usr/sbin split](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2010-December/074114.html)<br>This mailing list post is an interesting bit of Unix trivia.
* [How Much Is an Astronautâ€™s Life Worth?](http://reason.com/archives/2012/01/26/how-much-is-an-astronauts-life-worth)<br>Some interesting points on a controversial topic.
