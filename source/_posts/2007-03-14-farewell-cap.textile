Steve Rogers aka "Captain America has died":http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/books/03/07/captain.america/index.html in Marvel's recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(comics)">Civil War</a> story line. 

Although he never was among my favorite comic heroes, you just don't let a super hero die like this. And if you do, don't later resurrect him. I still can remember how I was traumatized when Superman died in the arms of Lois and how affected I was when all the other super heroes attended his funeral to show their respect, only to get disappointed by "Reign of the Supermen" and the later resurrection.

Farewall Captain America, and don't let them turn you into a zombie!
