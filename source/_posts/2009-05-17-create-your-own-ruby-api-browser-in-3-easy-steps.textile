  <li><b>Step 2:</b> Find some online API documentation. For Ruby I recommend "railsapi.com":railsapi.com or "RubyBrains":http://rubybrains.com. </li>

Of course this still requires you to have a working internet connection, but you could always use a local version of the API docs when creating the app. On a related note you should also check out "Goo":http://www.robinlu.com/blog/goo which is a nice alternative to gem server on OS X.
