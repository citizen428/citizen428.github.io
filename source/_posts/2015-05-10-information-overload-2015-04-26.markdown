I agree with a lot of the points mentioned in this article.
* [The 10 world cities with the highest murder rates – in pictures](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2014/jun/24/10-world-cities-highest-murder-rates-homicides-in-pictures)<br>
8 of them are in the Americas.
* [Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760-1761](http://revolt.axismaps.com/project.html)<br>
History, maps, revolution. Count me in!
* [The Largest Vocabulary in Hip Hop](http://experiments.undercurrent.com/)<br>
Nice combination of music, language, and statistics.
* [Before I Go: A Stanford neurosurgeon’s parting wisdom about life and time](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/03/12/before-i-go-a-stanford-neurosurgeons-parting-wisdom-about-life-and-time/)<br>

My take: because they are subjected to an extremely unhealthy work culture.
* [How many iPhones can fit in a 747?](http://learn.flexport.com/how-many-iphones-can-fit-in-a-747/)<br>
Interesting little writeup on transport logistics.
* [Want a Steady Income? There’s an App for That](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/magazine/want-a-steady-income-theres-an-app-for-that.html)<br>
The Silicon Valley really seems be believe that every problem can be solved with an app. At least these guys are trying...
* [The Fake 'Asian' Who Fooled 18th-Century London](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/04/london-forgotten-aryan-asian-fraudster/361035/?single_page=true)<br>
This very bizarre story would make a very interesting movie.
* [Vera Putinas verlorener Sohn](http://www.zeit.de/feature/wladimir-putin-mutter)<br>
An interesting story about Vladimir Putin's alleged real origins (in German, also available in [English](http://www.zeit.de/feature/vladimir-putin-mother)).
