I've always been a big fan of the handy little utility <a href="http://cheat.errtheblog.com">cheat</a> and recently became interested in <a href="http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/">OpenSolaris</a> (which btw runs fine on my Thinkpad x200s), so I did the obvious and created an OpenSolaris cheat sheet:

<a href="http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/open_solaris">http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/open_solaris</a>

It's still missing information regarding ZFS, but I guess I'll eventually add that too. And who knows, maybe I even get motivated enough for a nicely formatted Latex version...
