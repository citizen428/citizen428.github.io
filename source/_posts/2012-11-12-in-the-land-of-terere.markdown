Considering we left Paraguay almost three weeks ago, it's a shame I
haven't told you anything about this wonderful place yet. But let's
backtrack for a second and explore how we got to Paraguay. When we
looked for flights out of Curacao, going to Medellin seemed to be the
most obvious choice, considering the flight with Insel Air is dirt
cheap and takes about an hour. However, obvious choices are boring and
we kinda wanted to work our way up from the South of the continent to
the North, so we started looking into other options like Buenos Aires,
Montevideo or Santiago de Chile. But then I found a reasonably priced
flight to Asunción and given my previous wonderful experience in a
place nobody really goes to (Bangladesh) I started liking the idea. So
I introduced the subject to P. and we decided to go ahead and discover
Paraguay. And I'm glad we did!

Let me get one thing straight right away: Asunción is not the most
beautiful city in the world. In fact it's a bit on the ugly side, at
least around the downtown area. Apparently that's because a paranoid
dictator had all tall buildings torn down because he was afraid of
assassins hiding in them, but I'm not entirely sure that's true. It's
a pretty good story though. There are some beautiful old colonial
buildings left, but since there's not a lot of money to go around,
they are usually in a state of disrepair (or worse). There are however
some nicer modern neighborhoods like Villa Morra where we stayed with
a wonderful CouchSurfing host. Anyway, Asunción's a rather relaxed
South American capital, that feels safe and is full of wonderful,
helpful and welcoming people.

People who drink Tereré, all day, every day. Tereré I hear you ask?
It's basically like Mate, but made with ice-cold water and generally
with some extra herbs like mint added. It's refreshing, delicious, and
since you pass it around it's also a wonderful way to spend a couple
of hours with some friends while drinking and chatting. Which we did
quite a bit, for example with our friend Javier who just opened a
beautiful little [hostel](https://www.facebook.com/LaCasitaDeLaAbuelaHostalVerde) close to Asunción's downtown which you
definitely should check out if given the chance! Anyway, for
Paraguayans Tereré is more than just a drink, it's an integral part of
their culture and you'll see lots of people carrying around a thermos
at all times of day. They also always asked us we already had tried it
and were delighted to find out that we did and that we actually love
it!

Another vivid memory of Asunción are the public buses, which are
[colorful](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_dB1Xz3aYcZY/SN6diZeTBWI/AAAAAAAAANQ/gZWIsf_86QE/s400/BUS.JPG) and full of people selling all kinds of things (food, drinks,
little knickknacks). Also they don't really bother to stop for letting
people get on or off, they just kinda slow down and give you a chance
to practice your Ninja skills.

Now for one of my favorite topics, food: Paraguay was surprisingly ok
for a vegetarian. Not great and I had to eat a lot of carbs, but I
managed. While the modern Paraguayan diet is centered around meat, a
lot of the traditional dishes are vegetarian. This means that I
basically lived off [Sopa Paraguaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopa_paraguaya), [Chipa Guasu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipa_Guasu), [Chipa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipa), [Mbeju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbeju) and
[Pasqualina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torta_pasqualina). Fruit juices were ok too, but unfortunately they add sugar to them
unless you stop them, which is common in the region and something I
absolutely don't understand. We also cooked quite a bit for ourselves
which was rather nice since supermarkets are quite well-stocked and
carry lots of Italian-style products. They also offer quite a few
different soy-based "meats", which despite not being my favorite way
of eating soy is a rather convenient way to get some protein in your
diet.

Language-wise Paraguay also was rather interesting. While the city
population mostly speak Spanish (more on that later), Guaraní is still
the most common language in rural areas. The local accent was rather
easy to understand, although a lot of people mix in some Guaraní
words. Anyway, it was a good place to improve my listening skills, and
while I'm still far from being able to hold my own in an interesting
conversation, I'm definitely improving.

From Asunción we did a day trip to Areguá, a nice little village with
a stunning lake, a beautiful church placed on a picturesque hill and
lots of handicrafts. We stayed in the "Casa Amarilla", which is an old
colonial house that's part hostel and part art space and looks like
something out of a David Lynch movie. We also met a couple of nice
Argentinians who not only gave us a lift back to Asunción but also
invited us to stay with them in Corrientes, an offer we might take
them up on next month.

We then moved on to the pretty little border town of Encarnación,
which has a pretty costanera from where you can actually see Posadas
in Argentina. Nearby there are the stunning Jesuit ruins of Trinidad
and Jesús, and since Paraguay isn't exactly overrun by tourists, we
basically had them all to ourselves when we went there, which made me
feel a bit like Indiana Jones. Our CouchSurfing host also took us to
Itacua, a famous local religious site, which had some gorgeous views.
He also was kind enough to drive us over the bridge to Argentina,
which made for one of the more interesting border crossings of my
life. The border guard first looked confused when he got two
Paraguayan ID cards, as well as an Austrian and Italian passport, but
then stamped us in without so much as properly looking at us.

I guess that's enough for now, I'll soon write something about
Northeastern Argentina, where we spent around a week before moving on
to Uruguay from where I'm currently writing this.
