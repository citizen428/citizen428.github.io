Apparently there was a certain demand for "MethodFinder":https://github.com/citizen428/methodfinder and after being mentioned on "Ruby5":http://ruby5.envylabs.com, it now has almost 150 followers on GitHub as well as over 200 downloads on Rubygems, which is more than I ever expected.  There's also been some very nice feedback on Twitter:

MethodFinder, where have you been all my life?
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote @anentropic http://twitter.com/#!/anentropic/status/53086564179382272 %}
[...] that MethodFinder is quite awesome though I'm not sure I've ever needed one
{% endblockquote %}

MethodFinder is one of the coolest things about Squeak. Neat to see it's been ported to Ruby

{% endblockquote %}

Really amazing!!
{% endblockquote %}

That's quite motivating and I'm currently experimenting with some ideas that might eventually lead to another tool useful for Ruby learners.
