{% blockquote Julian Baggini http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/d2239780-4d4e-11e1-8741-00144feabdc0.html Atheism in America %}
In a nation that celebrates freedom of religion like no other, freedom not to be religious at all can be as hard to exercise as the right to swim the Atlantic.

* [The magic number](http://www.economist.com/node/21542763)<br/>While I don't share some of the author's opinions, the new Indian identity scheme certainly could have a positive influence on many people's lives.
* [Atheism in America](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/d2239780-4d4e-11e1-8741-00144feabdc0.html)<br/>Interesting article about the lives of atheists in the United States. I'm afraid there are parts of Austria where it wouldn't be too different.
* [I can still see your actions on Google Maps over SSL](http://blog.ioactive.com/2012/02/ssl-traffic-analysis-on-google-maps.html)<br/>A proof of concept for SSL traffic analyses/side channel-attacks, with an easy to understand video for your less security-aware friends.
* [Government 'may sanction nerve-agent use on rioters', scientists fear](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/government-may-sanction-nerveagent-use-on-rioters-scientists-fear-6612084.html)<br/>Brave new world, UK style.
* [The Man Who](http://www.universityobserver.ie/2012/02/08/the-man-who/)<br/>An article about Steven Moffat, writer of some of my favorite TV shows.
* [Stalin's Human-Ape Hybrids](http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4219)<br/>Skeptoid debunks the myth that Stalin tried to create an army of human-ape hybrids.
* [A Happy, Flourishing City With No Advertising](http://www.good.is/post/a-happy-flourishing-city-with-no-advertising)<br/>In 2006, the mayor of São Paulo banned all billboards and similar forms of advertising, in order to reduce "visual pollution".
* [The Gentle Art of Poverty](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1977/10/the-gentle-art-of-poverty/8241/?single_page=true/)<br/>This article from 1977 tells the story of an old man dealing with poverty in Southern California. An intense read, despite the bad copy editing.
* [Wired Opinion: The Perpetual, Invisible Window Into Your Gmail Inbox](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/02/perpetual-window-into-gmail/)<br/>Personally I regularly check all app permissions. I also have a Gmail label "Registrations" where I store signup mails and occasionally work through that and close/delete all accounts I don't use regularly.
* ["Ich empfand eine unbändige Wut"](http://derstandard.at/1328507315096/Ich-empfand-eine-unbaendige-Wut)<br/>Interview with a former member of El Salvador's guerilla movement, who was part of the first unit to discover the [El Mozote massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mozote_massacre).

{% blockquote Emer Sugrue http://www.universityobserver.ie/2012/02/08/the-man-who/ The Man Who %}
Doctor Who, for the uninitiated, is a show featuring an “eleven-hundred-and-three-year-old” alien who travels through space and time in a police box (called the TARDIS – Time and Relative Dimension in Space), fighting monsters and finding friends to take along with him, only ninety per cent of which have been very attractive women.
