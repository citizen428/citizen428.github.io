We all know that Ruby's a flexible beast, but just how much you can bend it is almost scary. How about inheriting from a class randomly chosen at runtime? Sure, no problem:

I dare you to find a use case for this ;-) And in case random isn't good enough for you, why not have the user choose the superclass for you?
