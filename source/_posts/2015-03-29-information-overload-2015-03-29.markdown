* [Why We Should Demand a Shorter Workweek](http://www.dsausa.org/shorter_work_weeks)<br>
To add some perspective: [Refusal of work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refusal_of_work)
* [The Lost Civilizations of Asia](http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/the-lost-civilizations-of-asia/)<br>
Some preservation would indeed be appreciated, many of the lesser known sites are slowly rotting away.
* [Why Birds Keep Crashing Into Cars And Planes](http://www.vocativ.com/culture/science/birdstrikes-aircrashes-birds-air-disasters/)<br>
Apparently because they judge the potential danger of approaching objects by distance and not by speed.
* [Burma's bizarre capital: a super-sized slice of post-apocalypse suburbia](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/19/burmas-capital-naypyidaw-post-apocalypse-suburbia-highways-wifi)<br>
I only drove through Naypyidaw by bus at night, but it sure did feel bizarre.
* [The great escape that changed Africaâ€™s future](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/great-escape-that-changed-africas-future)<br>
Highly recommended, a very good read and a gripping story.
* [Being an Animator in Japan Is Brutal](http://kotaku.com/being-an-animator-in-japan-is-brutal-1690248803)<br>
I'm no Japan expert, but I can't imagine that 1000$ a month is anywhere close to a living wage.
* [No more physics and maths, Finland to stop teaching individual subjects](http://www.sciencealert.com/no-more-physics-and-maths-finland-to-stop-teaching-individual-subjects)<br>
I'm not sure I like the premise, but education surely can do with an overhaul.
* [Guest Post: 5 Chinese Ghost Cities That Came Alive](https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/koos-jansen/guest-post-5-chinese-ghost-cities-came-alive/)<br>
Good read, especially because gives an alternative version on China's urban development.
* [Ebola whole virus vaccine shown effective, safe in primates](http://news.wisc.edu/23601)<br>
That's some great news.
* [The Origin of the Tale that Gavrilo Princip Was Eating a Sandwich When He Assassinated Franz Ferdinand](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gavrilo-princips-sandwich-79480741)<br>
Time for some history.
