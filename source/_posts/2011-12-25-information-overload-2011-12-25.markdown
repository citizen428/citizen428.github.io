They’ve reminded us that politics is not a matter of choosing among what we’re offered but of fighting for what we and others actually need, not to mention what we hope for.

* [MIT launches online learning initiative](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/mitx-education-initiative-1219.html)<br>After Stanford's successful online courses, the MIT also develops a new online platform on top of the already cool [OCW](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). I always welcome more good and free learning resources.
* [How to Learn About Everything](http://metamodern.com/2009/05/27/how-to-learn-about-everything/)<br>As you can see from the subtitle of this blog, this is something I'm also trying to do, with a comparable method.
* [Sleep Deficit: The Performance Killer](http://hbr.org/2006/10/sleep-deficit-the-performance-killer)<br>As someone who sometimes suffers from bouts of insomnia, I can attest to the bad effects lack of sleep can have. You may believe that you got used to it, but really, you don't.
* [Thank You, Anarchists](http://www.thenation.com/article/165240/thank-you-anarchists)<br>I know The Nation is a left-wing magazine, but it's still nice to see a positive article about anarchism somewhere.
* [One teachers approach to preventing gender bullying in a classroom](http://togetherforjacksoncountykids.tumblr.com/post/14314184651/one-teachers-approach-to-preventing-gender-bullying-in)<br>There should be more teachers like this.
* [Which reads faster, Chinese or English?](http://persquaremile.com/2011/12/21/which-reads-faster-chinese-or-english/)<br>Once again a language related article. The comments are also quite interesting by the way.
* [An Extraordinary Interview with Former Guantánamo Child Prisoner Mohammed El-Gharani](http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2011/12/16/an-extraordinary-interview-with-former-guantanamo-child-prisoner-mohammed-el-gharani/)<br>Some bits of this interview seem a bit odd to me, but you can judge that for yourself.
* [The Zelda Test (or Why no Zelda Clones?)](http://games.greggman.com/game/the-zelda-test-or-why-no-zelda-clones/)<br>I don't spend much time on playing video games anymore, but it's still good to read something like this by a real gaming nerd.
* [Über das Leben eines Heterojungen mit schwulen Eltern](http://www.arminsoyka.at/blog/uber-das-leben-eines-heterojungen-mit-schwulen-eltern/)<br>An Austrian exchange student describes his experience staying with a gay couple (in German).
* [Why We Haven't Met Any Aliens](http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/why_we_havent_met_any_aliens/)<br>While the overall gist of the article doesn't really strike home with me, I still find it an interesting thought experiment.

The business of humanity has become entertainment, and entertainment is the business of feeding fake fitness cues to our brains.
