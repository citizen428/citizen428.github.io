* [Don't scan, just ask](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4770.en.html)<br>This sounded a lot more interesting than it actually was, especially since the tool that was introduced is not publicly available (as far as I know that is).
* [Effective Denial of Service attacks against web application platforms](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4680.en.html)<br>Great talk, solid presentation, this is the type of talk you want to download the video for.
* [The Science of Insecurity](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4763.en.html)<br>Another great presentation, another definite recommendation.
* [How governments have tried to block Tor](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4800.en.html)<br>An inspiring and insightful presentation about government surveillance and Tor.
* [Apple vs. Google Client Platforms](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4676.en.html)<br>A security comparison of iOS and Android and the repective vendor's app markets.
* [Quantified-Self and OpenBCI Neurofeedback Mind-Hacking](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4756.en.html)<br>One big WTF and I definitely would have left, but unfortunately one of the 2 speakers had to borrow my ThinkPad power supply so I was stuck in this talk until the bitter end.
* [Hacker Jeopardy](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4775.en.html)<br>Fun as always, but this year's questions seemed a lot easier than the ones I remember from previous years.
