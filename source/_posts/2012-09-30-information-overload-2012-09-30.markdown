{% endblockquote %}

* [I Was a Warehouse Wage Slave](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/mac-mcclelland-free-online-shipping-warehouses-labor)<br>This sounds like early 19th century, not early 21st.
* [The Joy of Quiet](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/opinion/sunday/the-joy-of-quiet.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all)<br>A joy indeed.
* [Clean IT – Leak Shows Plans For Large-Scale, Undemocratic Surveillance Of All Communications](http://www.edri.org/cleanIT)<br>This reads like a marketing effort for darknets.
* [Meet the Man Who Built a 30-Story Building in 15 Days](http://www.wired.com/design/2012/09/broad-sustainable-building-instant-skyscraper/all/?pid=917&viewall=true)<br>He's Chinese, in case you wonder.
* [How Did the Duck Hunt Gun Work? ](http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/79429)<br>Another childhood mistery solved.
* [Lettland: Der Musterschüler fällt durch](http://derstandard.at/1347492611889/Lettland-Wirtschaftskrise-Emigration-demographische-Katastrophe)<br>Latvia is losing its population due to migration (in German).
* [The drugs don't work: a modern medical scandal](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/21/drugs-industry-scandal-ben-goldacre)<br>Most articles about pharmaceutical companies leave one slightly worried (or worse). This one is no exception.
