Today I've learned a valuable lesson the hard way: don't, I repeat, don't type <b>anything</b> in a shell while your mind is occupied with something else. I've seriously screwed up my system today because of this exact reason† and it took me quite a while to get everything back in a more or less working state.

I will have to use my limited time over the next few days to iron out the last few glitches, before I'm able to do something useful again.

† For all the curious ones: the incident involved <i>rm</i> and a wrong parameter. You can figure out what that means by yourself, once you stop laughing...
