After a lovely time in Paraguay (a separate post will follow), we explored the Northeast of Argentina a bit (Posadas, San Ignacio,
Iguazu Falls). Today we'll take an overnight bus to Colon were we'll cross into Paysandu (Uruguay) on Friday or so. We don't know how long we'll stay there yet, but after that we'll head back to Argentina to finally visit some cities.

Here's some pictures for now:
