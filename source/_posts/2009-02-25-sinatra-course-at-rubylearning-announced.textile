For a lot of people, Ruby became almost equivalent to "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/, but this doesn't mean that Rubyists can't choose from a wider selection of web frameworks. One of them is the microframework "Sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/, for which "RubyLearning":http://rubylearning.org will start a "course":http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/02/25/introduction-to-sinatra-a-new-course/ on March 21st. Registration is open now, the price is a reasonable US$3 for the first 15 people to sign up, US$4 for the next 25 and finally US$5 for everyone after that. Yours truly will also be a mentor for this course and would be happy to see some of you there!
