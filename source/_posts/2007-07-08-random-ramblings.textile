*) Ordered a presale ticket for the "Chaos Communication Camp 2007":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2007/Intro/

*) Got myself a pre-order copy of "VMware Fusion":http://www.vmware.com/beta/fusion/ which is an absolute bargain for $39.99, since it would be well worth the $79.99 it will cost later on.

*) Found out that "Tim Fite":http://myspace.com/timfite now also offers his 2004 album "2 Minute Blues" as a "free download on his website":http://www.timfite.com/songs.html. While you're there make sure to also get "Over the Counter Culture", which probably is the best new album I've heard this year.

Life's (mostly) good!
