As should be clear by now, I'm not overly good at writing these things regularly, so I won't even pretend to be sorry it's been over a month
since the last one, and I also won't promise that the next one will come any sooner. I also kinda gave up hope on ever properly filling you in on Argentina part 2 and 3 and Chile, so a very short summary will have to do:

_Argentina_

* Buenos Aires - a collective [Stockholm syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome) and one of the most interesting cities I've ever visited (see, Stockholm syndrome).
* Cordoba - A nice enough city, surrounded by a very pretty province.
* Mendoza - Lovely city, nice surroundings, spent Christmas in a great
little hostel and had an amazing bus ride to Santiage de Chile from
there.
* Salta - One of my favorite places in Argentina, a pretty, relaxed little town with some great architecture and a very nice and quirky [museum](http://www.museopajchasalta.com.ar/).
* Huamahuaca - While I'm not as enamored by it as other people, it's a nice place, with an amazing location in the Quebrada de Humahuaca and
some of Argentina's best food. The nearby [Hornacal](http://www.naturephotos.com/index.php#mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&s=0&p=15&a=0&at=0) mountain range is one of the most amazing things I've seen on this trip.

_Chile_

* Santiago - While many people don't seem to like it, I do. Good food, good nightlife, an active cultural life and very friendly people.
* Valparaiso - While it didn't live up to my expectations (there's too much hype around it), I did get to like it in the end, since it's
really a haven for street arts.
* Pichilemu - We didn't even stay in the city proper, but at the "Surf Farm" 15 minutes out of town by car, in the middle of nowhere. A great
place, hard to leave.
* La Serena/Coquimbo - Two nice little beaches at the coast, where we stayed with an amazing CouchSurfing host.
* San Pedro de Atacama - Surreal landscapes and the world's driest desert.

The rest of Bolivia and all of Peru (where we got end of February) will have to wait for the next time, whenever that will be. For the time being you can look at some pictures. although a suicidal SD-card took most of our Bolivia pictures with it :-(
