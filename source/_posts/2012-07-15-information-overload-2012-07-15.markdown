* [Relativistic Baseball](http://what-if.xkcd.com/1/)<br>[Randal Munroe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe) of xkcd fame has a new blog where he answers hypothetical questions about physics.
* [Scientists Create Molecule to Make Teeth Cavityproof](http://gizmodo.com/5924447/scientists-find-molecule-that-will-make-your-teeth-cavityproof)<br>And if that weren't enough, it can be added to sweets and chewing gum.
* [How the news gets out](http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2012/07/syria)<br>The Economist explains how it gets information from inside Syria.
* [How Kate Middleton’s Wedding Gown Demonstrates Wikipedia’s Woman Problem](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/07/13/kate_middleton_s_wedding_gown_and_wikipedia_s_gender_gap_.html)<br>While it's true that Wikipedia has a majority of male editors, this debate seems odd (men = articles on Linux, women = dresses and makeup). Decide for yourself.
* [German security experts find major flaw in credit card terminals](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/07/german-security-experts-find-major-flaw-in-credit-card-terminals/)<br>Karsten Nohl is at it again.
* [In Dieting, Magic Isn’t a Substitute for Science](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/health/nutrition/q-and-a-are-high-protein-low-carb-diets-effective.html?_r=1)<br>This article sums up how I lost around 30 kilos (around 66lbs.) in 10 month: less calories in (I still eat a lot, but reduced calories from drinks like beer or sodas), more calories out. And I've been stable for almost 4 years now.
* [Aftermath Of The Pirate Bay Trial: Peter Sundes Plea — In His Own Words](http://falkvinge.net/2012/07/06/aftermath-of-the-pirate-bay-trial-peter-sundes-plea-in-his-own-words/)<br>It's bad enough if corporations and lobbyists manipulate legislation, but once they also influence the judiciary system, things can get really nasty.
* [Q: Why Do We Wear Pants? A: Horses](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/q-why-do-we-wear-pants-a-horses/259696/)<br>I'm a fan of useless trivia.
