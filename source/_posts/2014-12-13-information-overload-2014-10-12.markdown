I know, I usually publish the Information Overload on Sundays, but my schedule has become so irregular...

* [15 Things You Shouldn't Believe About Africa](http://www.globalcitizen.org/Content/Content.aspx?id=3afe9b6c-b83f-4526-9df5-4fa704dbb9a1)<br>
What I can't believe is that this needed to be written...
* [The weird afterlife of the world's subterranean 'ghost stations'](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/25/-sp-world-subterranean-ghost-stations-tube-abandoned-underground)<br>
The Guardian City blog is one of my favorite web sites at the moment.
* [The Dalai Lama and the Politics of Reincarnation](http://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-dalai-lama-and-the-politics-of-reincarnation/)<br>
It will be interesting to see how this pans out.
* [A Young Chemist Explains How Legal Highs Work](http://www.vice.com/read/research-drugs-and-the-grey-market)<br>
People clearly want to take drugs, so maybe policy changes are in order.
* [Life in Timbuktu: how the ancient city of gold is slowly turning to dust](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/16/-sp-life-timbuktu-mali-ancient-city-gold-slowly-turning-to-dust)<br>
It did say it's one of my favorite web sites, didn't I?
* [Is There a Parallel Universe That's Moving Backwards in Time?](http://www.iflscience.com/physics/there-parallel-universe-thats-moving-backwards-time)<br>
The title of this website says it all, "I fucking love science".
* [Law and Order: Special Victims Unit](http://www.bangkokpost.com/lifestyle/social-and-lifestyle/448419)<br>
Lots of bad press for the Thai police lately, but I also always like other viewpoints.
* [China's Economy: Donâ€™t Bet on Beijing](http://thediplomat.com/2014/12/chinas-economy-dont-bet-on-beijing/)<br>
[The Diplomat](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Diplomat) confuses me. While some of their articles are interesting, I'm still wondering about their overall agenda.
* [The skin I live in](http://sea-globe.com/transgender-singapore-southeast-asia-globe/)<br>
The excellent Southeast Asia Globe with an article on transgender sex workers in Singapore.
* [A quick history of why Asians wear surgical masks in public](http://qz.com/299003/a-quick-history-of-why-asians-wear-surgical-masks-in-public/)<br>
After having lived in China, I don't even notice them anymore.
