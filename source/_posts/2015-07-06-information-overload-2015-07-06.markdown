* [Math for eight-year-olds: graph theory for kids!](http://jdh.hamkins.org/math-for-eight-year-olds/)<br>
This is a great example of how to present math to children!
* [Yes, androids do dream of electric sheep](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/18/google-image-recognition-neural-network-androids-dream-electric-sheep)<br>
Super interesting, and some beautiful images. See also [Inceptionism: Going deeper into Neural Networks](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPX0SCl7OzWilt9LnuQliattX4OUCj_8EP65_cTVnBmS1jnYgsGQAieQUc1VQWdgQ?key=aVBxWjhwSzg2RjJWLWRuVFBBZEN1d205bUdEMnhB).
* [Earth’s sixth mass extinction has begun, new study confirms](https://theconversation.com/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-has-begun-new-study-confirms-43432)<br>
:-(
* [More Than Just Peat and Smoke: The Best Islay Single Malts](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/best-islay-scotch-single-malt-whiskey.html)<br>
Consider this post a todo list ;-)
* [Harmony Korine on Kids: 'It would be impossible to make that film now'](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/22/harmony-korine-kids-20th-anniversary)<br>
I loved this movie when I was about the same age as its protagonists.
* [Hero Ex Royal Marine Saves 100 Civilians in Nairobi Mall Killings](http://www.sobify.com/hero-ex-royal-marine-saves-100-civilians-in-nairobi-mall-killings/)<br>
It's nice to read something good once in a while.
* [The Sikhs who saved Parmesan](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33149580)<br>
Very interesting story about migration.
* [Why We Cry on Planes](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/why-we-cry-on-planes/280143/)<br>
In case you ever wondered...
* [What Makes the Expat Lifestyle So Addictive?](http://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2015/06/21/what-makes-the-expat-lifestyle-so-addictive/)<br>
I may not agree with everything, but it's a good read.
* [There’s a dark side to startups, and it haunts 30% of the world’s most brilliant people](http://www.businessinsider.com/austen-heinzs-suicide-and-depression-in-startups-2015-7)<br>
30% seems high, but from personal experience I can confirm that this is a problem in our community.
