I just wrote a really long text, keeping you up to date on what's happening in citizen428 land. Then I accidently closed the tab and everything's gone. I don't feel like writing all this stuff again, so I just want to say that baby Jesus now is very sad, I'm a dull boy and the puppies are not safe anymore.
