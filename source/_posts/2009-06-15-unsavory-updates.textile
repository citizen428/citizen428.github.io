Today I felt like playing around with "unsavory":http://github.com/citizen428/unsavory/tree/master a bit more, which led to some minor improvements: 
<ul>
<li>code reorganization: the delicious class got moved to a separate file in lib/ and got a new method for easier retrieval of the URLs array</li>
<li>login credentials can now be read from a config file, thus making HighLine optional</li>
</ul>
Next on my list is packaging this up as a gem so people can simply install it with 'gem install unsavory'.
