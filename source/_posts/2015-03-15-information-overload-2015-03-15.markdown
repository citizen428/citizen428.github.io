* [Google crocks capacitors and deviates DRAM to root Linux](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/10/rowhammer/)<br>
That's one creative exploit.
* [Chinese Labor Strike: 5,000 Workers Strike At Factory Making Shoes For Nike, Timberland, Kenneth Cole; Police Dogs Deployed](http://www.ibtimes.com/chinese-labor-strike-5000-workers-strike-factory-making-shoes-nike-timberland-kenneth-1842606)<br>
There is a certain irony to labor strikes in "Communist" countries.
* [Psychoactive Plant May Hold Key to Reversing Diabetes](http://www.healthline.com/health-news/psychoactive-plant-may-hold-key-to-reversing-diabetes-030915)<br>
Always good to see some potential advancements for chronic diseases.
* [Government agents 'directly involved' in most high-profile US terror plots](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/21/government-agents-directly-involved-us-terror-plots-report)<br>
While there's no need to get the tinfoil hats out, this trend for entrapment by government agencies is rather disturbing.
* [Here’s what happened when Bogota decided to let graffiti artists do their thing](http://fusion.net/story/56993/heres-what-happened-when-bogota-decided-to-let-graffiti-artists-do-their-thing/)<br>
Bogota is a city I feel I didn't have enough time for. Certainly would be worth another visit.
* [Neil Gaiman: ‘Terry Pratchett isn’t jolly. He’s angry](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/24/terry-pratchett-angry-not-jolly-neil-gaiman)<br>
RIP Sir Terry Pratchett!
