Step 1. Be bored at worked.
Step 2. Get attracted by a <a href="http://www1.skyeurope.com/en/ commercial">discount airline</a>'s commercial in your favorite online newspaper.
Step 3. Discover that flights to "Bucharest":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest are incredibly cheap and decide to go there for a weekend in April.
Step 4. This is the crucial step: Don't pay attention while booking the flight and choose the wrong date for your return flight, so you end up booking 1,5 weeks in Romania.

Summary: "Christian":http://luchmhor.net and me will go to Romania from April 20th until April 30th. Wish us luck/fun/whatever.
