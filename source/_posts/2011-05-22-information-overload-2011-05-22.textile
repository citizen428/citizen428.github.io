<li>"Understanding the Fourier transform by Stuart Riffle":http://altdevblogaday.org/2011/05/17/understanding-the-fourier-transform/<br>You know I'm a big fan of good (math) explanations and this is no exception. I really like the color coded formula!</li>

<li>"On TermKit":http://acko.net/blog/on-termkit<br>While I'm not sure I'd use this, it's interesting to see the Unix terminal re-imagined.</li>
<li>"The People vs. Goldman Sachs":http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-people-vs-goldman-sachs-20110511<br>To get an idea what this is about, here's a quote from the article: "This is America: Corporate stealing is practically the national pastime, and Goldman Sachs is far from the only company to get away with doing it".</li>

<li>"Life is a cosmic giggle on the breath of the universe":http://www.viceland.com/int/v18n5/htdocs/life-is-a-cosmic-giggle-803.php?page=1<br>Wow, once again real life is much more screwed up than TV. If you think "Breaking Bad":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad is hardcore, read this article/interview.</li>
