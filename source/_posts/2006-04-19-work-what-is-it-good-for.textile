I'm "burned out":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_%28psychology%29. For good. I'm totally done. I'm dragging myself to work, trying to kill time and getting home before I manage to screw something up (again). I'm more cynical and bad-tempered than ever, which I guess is pretty hard for the people around me.

How about the other IT workers out there? Do you feel the same? And do you have any tips on how to get out of this?
