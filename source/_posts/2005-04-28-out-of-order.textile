Just a little heads up that I may be away longer than I originally intended. As you can see on the <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/devaway/">Devaway</a> page I expected inactivity in April. But now that my laptop started entertaining himself with random shutdowns which sometimes happen so frequently that you can't work anymore, this may take a little longer than planned...
