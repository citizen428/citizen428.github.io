While writing my "second Shoes app":http://the-shoebox.org/apps/128 I ran into the problem of how to require a gem from within Shoes. Luckily "the truth is out there":http://hackety.org/2008/05/08/clearingUpTheWholeShoesAndRubyGemsDeal.html, but I wanna share it with you nonetheless:

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
Shoes.setup do
  gem 'foo'
end
require 'foo'
{% endcodeblock %}

Enjoy!
