{% blockquote Susan Cain http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/mar/13/why-the-world-needs-introverts Why the world needs introverts %}
Nor are introverts necessarily shy. Shyness is the fear of social disapproval or humiliation, while introversion is a preference for environments that are not overstimulating. Shyness is inherently painful; introversion is not.

* [The Cold Reading Technique](http://denisdutton.com/cold_reading.htm)<br/>A long and very informative article on [cold reading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading).
* [How Engineering the Human Body Could Combat Climate Change](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/how-human-engineering-could-be-the-solution-to-climate-change/253981/)<br/>Interesting ideas that could spark very controversial ethical debates.
* [Kit Kat!](http://www.mikesblender.com/indexblog88.htm)<br/>On the role of Kit Kat in the Japanse education system and why there are over 45 different versions of it in Japan.
* [Cyborg snails power up](http://www.nature.com/news/cyborg-snails-power-up-1.10210)<br/>I guess implanted biofuel cells could lead to controversial debates too.
* [Kony 2012: the reaction](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/13/reality-check-kony-2012-reaction)<br/>The Guardian summarizes the various reactions to the [Kony 2012](http://www.kony2012.com/) campaign.
* [The Tau Manifesto](http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto)<br/>Since [Pi Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day) was celebrated during this week, it's time for me to post the Tau Manifesto again. All hail the superior circle constant! ;-)
* [Why the world needs introverts](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/mar/13/why-the-world-needs-introverts)<br/>Articles like this one are important to us introverts (I'm an [INTJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTJ) according to the Myers-Briggs personality test). It's getting kinda tiring to explain that one can be open and sociable and still an introvert at the same time.
* [Scientist creates lifelike cells out of metal](http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/stories/scientist-creates-lifelike-cells-out-of-metal)<br/>This article on abiogenesis is a little older, but I finally got around to read it.
* [Phänomen „Fakenger“](http://fm4.orf.at/stories/1695606/)<br>Interesting article about the bike messenger subculture and copycats (in German).
* [Australia's 'child labour camp'](http://au.news.yahoo.com/today-tonight/latest/article/-/12905379/australia-s-child-labour-camp/)<br>Run by Scientology.
