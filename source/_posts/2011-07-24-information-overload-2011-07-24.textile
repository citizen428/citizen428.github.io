<li>"How Khan Academy Is Changing the Rules of Education":http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/07/ff_khan/all/1<br/>Very nice piece on the "Khan Academy":http://www.khanacademy.org/, including examples of how it's used in class rooms as well as positive and negative feedback by educators.</li>
<li>"Chain World Videogame Was Supposed to be a Religion-Not a Holy War":http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/07/mf_chainworld/all/1<br/>Wow, I completely missed this last year, but this is a super-interesting piece on an even more interesting indie game.</li>
<li>"You are not running out of time":http://rahulbijlani.com/essays/you-are-not-running-out-of-time-essay/<br/>This really resonates with me and judging from the comments I'm not the only one.</li>

<li>"Why I talk openly about the deep dark hole I'm sitting in (and why you should too)":http://willinglycrazy.blogspot.com/2011/07/why-i-talk-openly-about-deep-dark-hole.html<br/>For various reasons this affects me on a very personal level and I can only agree with the message of this post.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/29/29687/1.html">&quot;In 30 Jahren wird es keinen Kapitalismus mehr geben&quot;</a><br/>Will capitalism really disappear within the next 30 years? Sometimes it definitely feels like it.</li>
<li>"After almost 20 years, math problem falls":http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-07-years-math-problem-falls.html<br/>Interesting result about approximating something NP-complete without something P-complete which might have a huge impact in several disciplines, from engineering to economics.</li>
