Quite often, the answer to that exasperated "why don't they just . . . ?" is green, and it folds.

* [Coding - the new Latin](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15916677)<br/>In the UK there's a drive for better computer science education. I'm not sure we'll see something similar in Austria any time soon...
* ['Most Beautiful Woman' By Day, Inventor By Night](http://www.npr.org/2011/11/27/142664182/most-beautiful-woman-by-day-inventor-by-night)<br/>A new book on actress Hedy Lamarr focuses on her inventions, not on her beauty.
* [What I Miss About Counter-Strike](http://eseanews.com/users/11811)<br/>This tribute to weirdness is also a good read for non-gamers, as it's essentially about achieving mastery in something.
* [Psst, kid... Wanna learn how to hack?](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/28/raspberry_pi/)<br/>Good article on the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.com/), a small and cheap ARM-based system I'm really looking forward to.
* [New India, old Europe](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/11/2011112414958187795.html)<br/>An Al Jazeera piece on India-EU relations.
* [Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb](http://crossthegreenmountain.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/life-during-wartime/)<br/>A detailed analysis of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, including lots of interesting sources.
* [Humanizing Bioinformatics](http://saaientist.blogspot.com/2011/10/humanizing-bioinformatics.html)<br/>The problems mentioned in this article don't only affect bioinformatics, we generally have so much data that good ways of visualizing and exploring become ever more important.
* [Swiss Govt: Downloading Movies and Music Will Stay Legal](http://torrentfreak.com/swiss-govt-downloading-movies-and-music-will-stay-legal-111202/)<br/>No matter how you feel about the topic at hand, it's refreshing to see a government come to its own conclusions instead of just jumping on the lobbyist bandwagon.
* [If Everyone Else is Such an Idiot, How Come You're Not Rich?](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/12/if-everyone-else-is-such-an-idiot-how-come-youre-not-rich/249430/)<br/>I admit to sometimes being guilty of this too. Just because people reach different conclusions than you, doesn't mean they are necessarily stupid. They just may have different — and often more — information than you.
* [In Athens](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n23/james-meek/diary)<br/>While the situation in Greek may look bleak, the attitudes of the citizens portrayed in this article makes me hopeful.

{% blockquote James Meek http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n23/james-meek/diary In Athens %}
There was a lot of talk about ‘convergence’ in the run-up to Greece joining the euro, as if swapping a weak currency for a strong one would magically turn a corrupt, nepotistic economy of olive groves and tourist beaches into a transparent, meritocratic Bavaria-on-the-Aegean.
