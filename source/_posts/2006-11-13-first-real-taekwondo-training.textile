After my two private lessons last week I had my first full Taekwondo training session today. Here's what I learned: My overall lifestyle and sports don't really mix. Sex, drugs and Rock'n'Roll - unfortunately I'm doing way better in some categories than in others - definitely took a beating (pun intended) from martial arts. My lungs declared war on me (damn you cheap Chinese cigarettes!), my pulse was going so fast that I was afraid an 8bit counter might not suffice for counting it and various other parts of my body just seemed very surprised to get used again. But once this painful first 15 minutes were over, the following 50 minutes were actually pretty cool and I'm looking forward to Thursday's session.
