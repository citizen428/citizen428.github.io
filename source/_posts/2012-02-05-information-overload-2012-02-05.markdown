{% blockquote William Gibson http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/24/2724370/william-gibson-intervie An interview with William Gibson %}
[T]oday's strangeness, while only a few mouse-clicks away from anyone, becomes difficult to find because it has to occur to you to Google it. You may be able to Google everything, but the trick is figuring what you need to Google.
{% endblockquote %}

* [Everything You Thought You Knew About Learning Is Wrong](http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/01/everything-about-learning/)<br/>I like articles on learning, this one has a few good tips.
* [An interview with William Gibson](http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/24/2724370/william-gibson-interview)<br/>Title says it all.
* [Netherlands makes net neutrality a law](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13886440)<br/>This is not the first sensible law the Netherlands pass.
* [As Anonymous protests, Internet drowns in inaccurate anti-ACTA arguments](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/internet-awash-in-inaccurate-anti-acta-arguments.ars)<br/>If you are following the current ACTA debate (and you should be), this one is a must read.
* [#Riot: Self-Organized, Hyper-Networked Revolts&mdash;Coming to a City Near You](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/12/ff_riots/all/1)<br/>The second Wired article in this week's issue, a very interesting piece on crowds, flash mobs and riots in connection with Social Media.
* [Interview With A Ketamine Chemist](http://www.vice.com/read/interview-with-ketamine-chemist-704-v18n2)<br/>Fascinating interview with the creator of some [dissociative drugs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative).
* [The Myth of Europe](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/01/03/the_myth_of_europe?page=full)<br/>A very thorough and interesting take on the EU and European identity. I for one would be sad if the Union failed, because I really enjoy a Europe with almost no borders, the right to work and live in any of the 27 member states and so on. I don't think that the level of centralization this has reached is the way to go though...
* [To My Old Master](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/01/to-my-old-master.html)<br/>A letter from a former slave to his old "master".
* [Four Difficult Questions Regarding Bullying and Youth Suicide](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2011/12/12/questions-bullying-suicide.html)<br/>Intersting questions for a necessary debate.
* [You Will Never Kill Piracy, and Piracy Will Never Kill You](http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/02/03/you-will-never-kill-piracy-and-piracy-will-never-kill-you/)<br/>Despite the headline, this has been published by Forbes.
