Well, last week was rather relaxing for me. Besides <a href="http://citizen428.net/archives/183-GLEP-34-German-descriptions-and-a-little-screenshot.html">adding German descriptions</a> for GLEP 34, my Gentoo work only involved the occassional version bumping and keywording of Ebuilds.

This gave me some free time to start playing around with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a>, which so far has proven to be an excellent and easy to use framework. Thanks to <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~pythonhead/blog/">Rob</a> for adding this to the tree, because I was too lazy to do it for several month... 

I also spent the last week on trying out a borrowed <a href="http://www.vodafone.com/article/0,3029,CATEGORY_ID%253D50202%2526LANGUAGE_ID%253D1%2526CONTENT_ID%253D248224,00.html">Vodafone UMTS datacard</a> for my notebook (nifty, anyone wanna buy me one?) as well as improving my Snooker skills (finally an 18 point break, woohoo!). And yesterday a friend and I did some good ol' funny <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luejacking">bluejacking</a> while we were <a href="http://www.die-waescherei.at/">having brunch</a>. 

Finally I wanted to say that I really despise certain people who <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~ciaranm/random//20050326.001.shtml">radomly whore out their Amazon wishlists</a>. Actually that was just a blatant lie to shamelessly advertise <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/registry/XFQ04S6N8UUE/">my own wish list</a>.
