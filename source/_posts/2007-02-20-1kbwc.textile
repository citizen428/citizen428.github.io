Yesterday we played two games of "1000 Blank White Cards":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Blank_White_Cards at the "Metalab":http://www.metalab.at which was quite a lot of fun. The cards we created ranged from "Emo Cheese" (which cuts itself), "MySpace down" (which of course lets emo cheese melt) to the even more bizarre "Milchschnitte frisst U-Bahn" (sorry, I couldn't possibly translate this to English). If you want to spend a nice evening with your friends, 1KBWC definitely is an option which you should keep in mind.
