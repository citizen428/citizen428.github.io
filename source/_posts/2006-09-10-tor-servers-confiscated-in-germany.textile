Since I was pretty busy with personal stuff during the last few days, I hadn't noticed that two days ago German authorities started confiscating "Tor":http://tor.eff.org/ middleman servers. That changed when earlier today I received an email from the owner of a confiscated system, who wants to get in touch with other Tor admins, in order to start a kind of "Knowledge Base" for people who were affected by the recent confiscations or who (still) want to set up their own Tor server. Since I'm also running "such a baby":http://serifos.eecs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/desc.pl?q=blingblingserver (which never was an exit node though) on a virtual server in Germany, I'm of course interested in this recent development, so I want to share the informative links provided in his mail with you.

Don't get me wrong, child pornography is one of the worst crimes I can think of, and I wish the German authorities all the best in finding the people they are after. I do however feel that the route taken here wasn't ideal, as it may well lead to a negative perception of Tor in the general public.

That's why I've tripled the total amount of traffic Tor is allowed to serve on my system and "donated some money":http://tor.eff.org/donate.html.en to the project. I would advise you to do the same! Besides that I also encourage you to use Tor and promote it to other people, because anonymity is something that can't be gained, only lost.
