Today I stumbled upon a post called <a href="http://www.r-chart.com/2010/08/github-stats-on-programming-languages.html">GitHub Stats on Programming Languages</a>, where the author uses <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to create various graphs about GitHub's top 10 programming languages. He was nice and posted his <a href="http://github.com/ezgraphs/R-Programs/blob/master/git_lang_stats.txt">data set</a>, so I had a go at it with <a href="http://data-sorcery.org/">Incanter</a>.

Load the necessary libraries:
<script src="http://gist.github.com/518090.js?file=gistfile1.clj"></script>

Then read in the data set (the delimiter defaults to \, which can be changed with the :delim option) and create a (somewhat arbitrary) list of languages to examine:
<script src="http://gist.github.com/518090.js?file=gistfile2.clj"></script>

Get a tabular view of the data:
<script src="http://gist.github.com/518090.js?file=gistfile5.clj"></script>

<div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/citizen428/dtc5e/screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-19.02.03"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100810-cqyy9wcfe8biqcwt83k7y91puy.preview.jpg" alt="Screen shot 2010-08-10 at 19.02.03" /></a><br /></div>

Narrow the data set down to languages of interest:
<script src="http://gist.github.com/518090.js?file=gistfile3.clj"></script>

Display a bar chart of repositories per user (this has to be within the with-data form shown above):
<script src="http://gist.github.com/518090.js?file=gistfile4.clj"></script>

<div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/citizen428/dtchx/screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-23.40.36"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100810-mg1kd6257pstaeqct2hr9e33ei.preview.jpg" alt="Screen shot 2010-08-10 at 23.40.36" /></a><br /></div>

The full code:
<script src="http://gist.github.com/518090.js?file=gistfile6.clj"></script>

I just love how simple Incanter makes this type of thing. It's an immensely cool and useful library, which can do much more than what I showed in this post (and previous ones). I hope that one day there'll be a book about it!
