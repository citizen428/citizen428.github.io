I used to be a big gamer, especially when it came to console games. Nowadays I don't have much time for that anymore, but I'm still quite interested in gaming culture and games as a medium. I'm especially fond of indie games, since their authors can afford to explore stranger concepts than more mainstream development teams. Here's a list of some of my favorites, most (all?) of which should be available on Windows, Mac and Linux:

* [And Yet It Moves](http://www.andyetitmoves.net/): Awesome physics-based platformer, featuring a very unique design.
* [Atom Zombie Smasher](http://blendogames.com/atomzombiesmasher/): Probably my absolute favorite at the moment. Great presentation, awesome music and an interesting twist on the tower defense genre.
* [Braid](http://www.braid-game.com/): Cute puzzle game that utilizes time as a central element of the game mechanics.
* [Crayon Physics Delux](http://crayonphysics.com/): Ok, I'm a sucker for physics based games, and this is no exception. The great visual style definitely helps.
* [Desktop Dungeons](http://www.desktopdungeons.net/): While the developers are working on a "proper" version now, the original alpha is still available for free. Think of it as the bare essence of rogue-likes.
* [Osmos](http://www.hemispheregames.com/osmos/): I really like this one for it's almost meditative quality.
* [Sword of Fargoal Legend](http://www.fargoal.com/): Another dungeon crawler that proves that good game mechanics are more important than fancy graphics.
* [Trauma](http://www.traumagame.com/): Maybe the most unique game in this list, this point and click adventure deals with the psychological trauma of a young woman who survived a car crash. Eerie atmosphere, great presentation.
* [VVVVVV](http://thelettervsixtim.es/): A 2d puzzle platformer that I'm quite fond of. Messing with gravity while listening to chiptune music? Count me in!
* [World of Goo](http://www.worldofgoo.com/): The cute Gooballs alone are a reason to play this one.
