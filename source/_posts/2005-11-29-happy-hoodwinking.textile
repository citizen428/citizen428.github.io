<i>You have nil shillings. You are a simple cleric, you have 10 more shillings to earn before you have proven your xpath/regexen charming skills on par with the druids. A real druid will check your work and pay you soon enough.</i> - "http://hoodwink.d/":http://hoodwink.d/

But I've been working hard and tried to prove these druids that my xpath and regex skills are up to their standards. I have hopefully earned my first shilling and I've earned it with my very own site! :) So you hoodwinkers out there, feel free to leave your winks instead of regular comments from now on! 

And don't be afraid when you have nfc what I'm talking about, "this link":http://hoodwinkd.hobix.com/ explains it all, so open your eyes and feel around...
