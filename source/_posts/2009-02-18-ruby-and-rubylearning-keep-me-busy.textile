If you are interested in finally learning Ruby, but don't have the motivation to do it on your own, you should definitely check out  "RubyLearning":http://rubylearning.org, it's a great way to learn together with other people but at your own pace.

Right now I'm involved in three different courses as a student and/or mentor: 

<ul>
<li>First off there's the 10th batch of the free Core Ruby Programming course, which started on January 23rd and has over 700 participants, some of whom are really active. I have a "GitHub repo for this course":http://github.com/citizen428/rubylearning-forpc101/tree/master, but to avoid spoilers I haven't committed the exercises from week 5-8 yet. BTW: the next batch will start on March 14th! :)</li>
<li>I'm also participating in the paid Ruby Programming with "Shoes":http://shoooes.net/ course which is quite a lot of fun, the repo can be found <a href="http://github.com/citizen428/rubylearning-poirpwsc101/tree">here</a>.</li>
<li>Last but not least there is a free course on Git and GitHub which will start this Saturday (January 21st), so if you are interested in that topic you should sign up right away!</a>
</ul>

Besides all these courses I'm working on a "Shoes tutorial":http://github.com/ashbb/shoes_tutorial_html/tree together with "ashbb":http://github.com/ashbb, have my own little "Shoes experiments":http://github.com/citizen428/littlesteps/tree and am reading "quite":http://www.hokstad.com/compiler "some":http://practicalruby.blogspot.com/2007/02/ruby-metaprogramming-introduction.html "interesting":http://www.jamievandyke.com/blog/2009/01/09/building-a-gem-using-bdd.html "articles":http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2009/02/stackful-rubinius-interview.html.

Happy Rubying everyone!
