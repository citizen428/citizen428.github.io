Today I found a neat "userstyle":http://userstyles.org/ for GMail called "GMail.app":http://userstyles.org/styles/3845 which gives the site a Mac-like appearance. It can be used with "Stylish":https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2108/ or "Greasemonkey":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748 and I like the style quite a lot.

P.S. The new "IMAP Access":https://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?topic=12760 for GMail is much appreciated too.
