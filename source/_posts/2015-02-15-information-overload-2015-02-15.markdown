* [hackme: Deconstructing an ELF File](http://manoharvanga.com/hackme/)<br>
Great read. If you like this sort of thing, I can wholeheartedly recommend [A Bug Hunter's Diary](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593273851/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593273851&linkCode=as2&tag=citizen4blog-20&linkId=TQPCBOME4UONL52F) (affiliate link).
* [10 Things People Once Complained Would Ruin The English Language](http://io9.com/10-things-people-once-complained-would-ruin-the-english-1684240298)<br>
Next up: the Internet.
* [Samsung's warning: Our Smart TVs record your living room chatter](http://www.cnet.com/au/news/samsungs-warning-our-smart-tvs-record-your-living-room-chatter/)<br>
If you read the article, also read this comment: [comment](http://fyre.it/PlswOh.4)
* [Singapore: A Mutiny Like No Other](http://thediplomat.com/2015/02/singapore-a-mutiny-like-no-other/)<br>
A bit of history for the 50 years anniversary this year.
* [No Big Bang? Quantum equation predicts universe has no beginning](http://phys.org/news/2015-02-big-quantum-equation-universe.html)<br>
This week's most discussed Physic's article.
* [Chinese charge government officials for being part of “illegal underground Tibetan independence organization”](http://thespeaker.co/chinese-charge-government-officials-part-illegal-underground-tibetan-independence-organization/)<br>
I have to say I'm somewhat surprised by this.
* [A City Where Everyone Works, There is No Police, and the Salary is 1200 Euros](http://www.livetravelenjoy.com/a-city-where-everyone-works-there-is-no-police-and-the-salary-is-1200-euros/)<br>
This is not some sort of socialist utopia, but a real place.
* [Does Work Really Work?](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/l-susan-brown-does-work-really-work)<br>
Somewhat older, but still a very good read.
* [Spanish is the happiest language, Chinese the most balanced, new study reveals](http://www.sciencealert.com/spanish-is-the-happiest-language-chinese-is-the-most-balanced-new-study-reveals)<br>
Language ans statistics, of course I like this.
