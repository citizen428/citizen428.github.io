* [New Year's Resolution: Full Disk Encryption on Every Computer You Own](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/newyears-resolution-full-disk-encryption-every-computer-you-own)<br>The [EFF](https://www.eff.org) has a great suggestion for a New Year's resolution.
* [My Favorite Strange Number: Î©](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/12/my_favorite_strange_number_cla.php)<br>Yeah for obscure math.
* [Richard Stallman Was Right All Along](http://www.osnews.com/story/25469/Richard_Stallman_Was_Right_All_Along)<br>It's not often enough that one reads something positive about RMS, which frankly speaking is a shame.
* [Zukunft in Selbstverwaltung](http://www.taz.de/Armenviertel-in-Caracas/!84778/)<br>People in Venezuela's capital are organising themselves in order to take care of things the state fails to provide (in German).
* [Uncloaking a Slumlord Conspiracy with Social Network Analysis](http://www.orgnet.com/slumlords.html)<br>Using social network analysis for social justice.
* [U.S. Government Calls to Censor Twitter Threaten Free Speech](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/01/us-government-calls-censor-twitter-threaten-free-speech)<br>Yes, that's 2 articles by the EFF in one issue of the Information Overload. It's not my fault they write so much sensible stuff...
* [Learning From The Masters: Level Design In The Legend Of Zelda](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6582/learning_from_the_masters_level_.php)<br>See this as a kind of follow-up to another Zelda related article I posted not so long ago.
* [Mathematicians Solve Minimum Sudoku Problem](http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/27469/)<br>Unfortunately this was proven by using a computer to brute force the problem space, much like the [Four Color Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem). A "proper" proof would be nice and I'm sure it would make for an interesting read.
* [An Optimistic History of the Next 40 Years](http://io9.com/5873485/an-optimistic-history-of-the-next-40-years)<br>That's certainly a more optimistic guess than anything I can come up with. Unfortunately I'm afraid this will stay the stuff for SciFi novels...
* [David Lynch: Why brutality makes me laugh](http://www.salon.com/2012/01/03/david_lynch_why_brutality_makes_me_laugh/singleton/)<br>An interview with David Lynch about his latest musical project.
