Ok, here we go: I hate the Lucky Couple (tm)! Don't get me wrong, I'm no frustrated sicko who hates all happy people in his vicinity, at least not most of the time. It's just that I really can't stand that particular kind of couple who are so offensively in love that the average Hollywood love story seems like a Homerian tragedy when comared to the uberhappy Lucky Couple (tm). Really, if you're in a restaurant and all you are doing is petting on the verge to hard-core pornography, either go home or at least have the decency to go all the way and give the people around you something to see. Actually being happy, kissing and everything else the average couple does is perfectly ok, but I absolutely hate the way the Lucky Couple (tm) involves the whole room in their private life without realizing that WE DON'T CARE. Really. We don't.
