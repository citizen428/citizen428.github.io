It's time for some good Ruby-related news again! After version bumping <a href="http://ncurses-ruby.berlios.de/">ncurses-ruby</a> I added two new packages to the tree.

The first one is <a href="http://ruby-mp3info.rubyforge.org/">ruby-mp3info</a> and was submitted via Bugzilla. It's written in pure Ruby and gives you access to a lot of low level information about mp3 files, like bitrate and samplerate. Besides that it can read and write id3v1 and read id3v2.

But the really cool thing I've added today is <a href="http://rubytorrent.rubyforge.org/">RubyTorrent</a>. I've stumbled across this project a while ago and took the 0.3 release as a motivation to finally add it to the tree. Check it out, it's really cool stuff.

Here's an example that I've stolen from the project's website:
{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
require 'rubytorrent'
bt = RubyTorrent::BitTorrent.new(ARGV.shift)
thread = Thread.new do
  while true
    puts bt.percent_completed
    sleep 15
  end
end
bt.on_event(self, :complete) { thread.kill }
thread.join
{% endcodeblock %}
Yeah, that's a BitTorrent client. Really. Nifty, isn't it?
