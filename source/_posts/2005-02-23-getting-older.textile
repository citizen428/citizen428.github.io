Ok, most of the people don't like getting older. Nonetheless - like everything in life - it has its upsides too. The great <a href="http://www.bouncingsouls.com">Bouncing Souls</a> summed it up very well in their biography:

"<i>Love became something deeper and lasting, parties became gatherings instead of escapes, home became a feeling instead of mortar and wood.</i>"

A remarkably true sentence, that puts getting older in a new perspective. At least for me.<!--more-->The Bouncing Souls also have that really great song called "'87", which can be found on the album "Hopeless Romantic" and which feels like I've written it myself...

<b>'87</b>
<i>Do you remember when the days gone by 
or is there no point for us to even try
Back when we didn't have a care in the world,
Getting drunk and chasing girls
Do you remember the days gone past and how we
always wanted the good times to last 
<b>The time we spent hanging out is how we learned what life is about</b>
Everything is set for the perfect night
when music is playing and it sounds just right
It gets inside and helps you to be all that
you want and you are free
<b>Those times that we all hoped would last
it seems that they've gone by so fast
I woke up one day and i was 25 with a hell
of a hangover and some demented sense of pride</b>
All we had was our dreams that's all we needed to be free
After the party came and went i found myself half bent
I had to stop and look around and my friends were all i found
<b>All these things i thought were wrong 
but these contradictions they made me strong</b>
<b>I know i can be free and it all came from inside of me</b>
All we had was our dreams
that's all we needed to be free
Do you remember? I do!</i>

(Emphasis added by me to highlight the parts I like the most.)
