This afternoon I had the time to finally watch the "PeepCode":http://peepcode.com/ "Meet MacRuby":http://peepcode.com/products/meet-macruby screencast.

In case you don't know "MacRuby":http://www.macruby.com/, it's a Ruby interpreter sitting on top of "Objective-C":http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/ and OS X core technologies (see also "here":http://citizen428.net/archives/365-Ruby-implementations-and-why-we-should-care.html).

During the 74 minute screencast you will build a basic but functional Twitter client, and in the process learn about MacRuby and "Cocoa":http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/ basics, using "Xcode":http://developer.apple.com/tools/macosxtools.html and "InterfaceBuilder":http://developer.apple.com/tools/interfacebuilder.html to develop and bundle your application and many other interesting topics.

The screencast is very well structured, easy to follow and full of good and practical information, including perks and rough edges of the current MacRuby version. All in all a really enjoyable and informative video, which is well worth US$9 (or less if you buy packs of credits)!
