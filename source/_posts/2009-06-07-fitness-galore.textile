Since my trip last year I have been fitter than I've been for ages, thanks to a weight-loss of about 25kg, more exercise and a healthier diet. Through "kyrah's tweets":http://twitter.com/kyrah I learned about a workout program called "one hundred pushups":http://hundredpushups.com/ and decided to have a closer look today. I took the initial test and only managed a meager 12 good-form pushups, but they were always one of my weak spots. At least I start from the most challenging category. Through the site I also found the two related programs "two hundred situps":http://www.twohundredsitups.com/ and "two hundred squats":http://www.twohundredsquats.com, where the initial tests looked a lot friendlier: with 35 situps and 40+ squats both programs suggest that I start from week 3. :-)

Now let's see how effective these workouts will turn out to be.
