After an almost 2 year hiatus, it's time to revive this series, although I'm not yet sure if it's going to be weekly again.

* [10 Lessons From Real-Life Revolutions That Fictional Dystopias Ignore](http://io9.com/10-lessons-from-real-life-revolutions-that-fictional-dy-1634087647)<br>
Ignoring artistic license, there are some interesting points here regarding real life revolutions.
* [Enter Pyongyang](http://vimeo.com/102051605)<br>
An interesting video about the normally extremely secluded DPRK.
* [How ISIS Works](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/16/world/middleeast/how-isis-works.html)<br>
Some background information on organization, finances, etc.
* [Life in Ulaanbaatar's tent city is hard](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/03/mongolia-ulanbaatar-ger-yurt-tent-city)<br>
A nice piece on the tent slums of Ulaanbaatar.
* [Tunisian street art - in pictures](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/sep/03/tunisian-street-art-in-pictures)<br>
Amazing pictures from the "Djerbahood" project.
* [How quitting my corporate job for my startup dream f*cked my life up](https://medium.com/everything-about-startups-and-entrepreneurship/how-quitting-my-corporate-job-for-my-startup-dream-f-cked-my-life-up-3b6b3e29b318)<br>
IMHO one of the more reasonable startups pieces I read lately.
* [In Maryland, a Soviet-Style Punishment for a Novelist](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/in-cambridge-md-a-soviet-style-punishment-for-a-novelist/379431/)<br>
The times they are a-changin'...
* ["Music is a weapon" â€“ Alec Empire on Digital Hardcore](http://www.electronicbeats.net/en/features/monologues/sound-is-a-weapon-alec-empire/)<br>
A good read not only for ATR fans.
* [Khartoum: the most selfish city?](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/19/khartoum-most-selfish-city-sudan-arab-capital)<br>
This article certainly enhanced my limited understanding of Sudanese issues.
* [Stir crazy](http://sea-globe.com/stir-crazy-thailand-prisons-southeast-asia-globe/)<br>
The SEA Globe writes about the Thai prison system.
