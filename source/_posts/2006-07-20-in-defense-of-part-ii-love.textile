Since too many of life's pleasures are demonized by all the greyfaces out there, I've decided to start a new series called "In defense of", where I'll collect quotes, song lyrics, etc. which show them in a different and maybe more positive way.

Does love really need that kind of defense? If we'd be talking about the watered down Hollywood version, this post would most probably be pretty obsolote. But when it comes to the real thing, involving real people, feeling real happiness and despair, things may look a little different...

"To live is like to love -
all reason is against it,
and all healthy instinct for it."

Although a little too pathetic for my taste, it's just too cool to have Bruce Lee in here!
<i>
"Love is like a friendship caught on fire.
In the beginning a flame, very pretty,
Often hot and fierce,
But still only light and flickering.
As love grows older,
Our hearts mature
And our love becomes as coals,
Deep-burning and unquenchable."
</i>
- Bruce Lee

"A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature
To stop speech when words become superfluous."

"Love is like a rumor,
Everyone talks about it,
But no one truly knows."

"Love is a haunting melody
That I have never mastered
And I fear I never will."
</i>
- William S. Burroughs

<i>
"Love me without fear
Trust me without questioning
Need me without demanding
Want me without restrictions
Accept me without change
Desire me without inhibitions
For a love so free....
Will never fly away".
</i>

Love Is A Burning Thing
And It Makes A Fiery Ring
Bound By Wild Desire
I Fell Into A Ring Of Fire

I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
I Went Down, Down, Down
And The Flames Went Higher

And It Burns, Burns, Burns
The Ring Of Fire
The Ring Of Fire

I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
I Went Down, Down, Down
And The Flames Went Higher

And It Burns, Burns, Burns
The Ring Of Fire
The Ring Of Fire

The Taste Of Love Is Sweet
When Hearts Like Ours Meet
I Fell For You Like A Child
Oh, But The Fire Went Wild

I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
I Went Down, Down, Down
And The Flames Went Higher

And It Burns, Burns, Burns
The Ring Of Fire
The Ring Of Fire

I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
I Went Down, Down, Down
And The Flames Went Higher

And It Burns, Burns, Burns
The Ring Of Fire
The Ring Of Fire

And It Burns, Burns, Burns

The Ring Of Fire
