Since I won't manage to publish a new issue of Information Overload every Sunday, from now I'll adopt a "whenever I feel like it" schedule.

* [It Only Took Four Months For China To Achieve A Jaw-Dropping Reduction In Carbon Emissions](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/05/15/3659355/china-coal-use-drops/)<br>
That's good news for a change.
* [Why so many Dutch people work part time](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-12?fsrc=scn/tw/wl/ee/st/ed/whysomanydutchpeopleworkparttime)<br>
Bottom line: because they are smart.
* [Stalking Your Friends with Facebook Messenger](https://medium.com/@arankhanna/stalking-your-friends-with-facebook-messenger-9da8820bd27d)<br>
This illustrates nicely how location data could be correlated and why that is a problem.
* [A TED speaker coach shares 11 tips for right before you go on stage](http://blog.ted.com/a-ted-speaker-coach-shares-11-tips-for-right-before-you-go-on-stage/)<br>
* [Why French Kids Don't Have ADHD](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/suffer-the-children/201203/why-french-kids-dont-have-adhd)<br>
Answer: more reasonable parenting.
* [The people who think they are made of glass](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32625632)<br>
Speaking of psychology, this is one of the stranger conditions I've heard of.
* [»Ich bin in Rage angesichts unserer Sexualkultur«](http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/43140)<br>
Interesting interview with a sexologist (in German).
* [Skyping with the enemy: I went undercover as a jihadi girlfriend](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/french-journalist-poses-muslim-convert-isis-anna-erelle)<br>
Title says it all, an intense read.
* [A Border Town Built for Vice](http://narrative.ly/stories/a-border-town-built-for-vice/)<br>
Border towns can be fascinating places.
* [Nigeria Outlaws Female Genital Mutilation](http://mediablackoutusa.com/nigeria-outlaws-female-genital-mutilation/)<br>
While this won't solve the problem, it's a good first step.
