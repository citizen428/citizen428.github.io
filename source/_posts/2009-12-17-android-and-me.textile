Last Monday I got an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> phone from work (unfortunately A1 still only has the HTC Magic, but I don't want to be ungrateful) and I obviously had to get into the whole community firmware thing and all. Here are some links that I hope are interesting and/or useful:
<ul><br />
<li><a href="http://developer.htc.com/adp.html">Fastboot for Mac</a> (you have to scroll down a bit)</li><br />
<li><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=529019">Engineering SPL for HTC Magic</a></li><br />
<li><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=4029315&#38;postcount=1">Amon_RA Sapphire Recovery Image</li><br />
<li><a href="http://wiki.smartphonefrance.info/firmware-htcmagic.ashx">Smartphone France Recovery and Firmware Image</a> (nice image, already rooted)</li><br />
<li><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=556933%26highlight=theofficial%2Brogers">TheOfficial Rogers ROM</a> (very nice Android 1.5 ROM, needs root before installing)</li><br />
</ul>

One last word of advice: save your APN settings before you flash your phone!
