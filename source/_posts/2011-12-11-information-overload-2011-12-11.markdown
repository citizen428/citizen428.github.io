As Alan Kay, a major pioneer of today’s software-eaten planet, pointed out recently, the Internet doesn’t have stop, shut down, or rewind buttons. Once it was turned on, history was essentially rebooted.

* [The Discovery of Dolphin Language](http://wakeup-world.com//2011/11/28/the-discovery-of-dolphin-language/)<br/>I'm always interested in articles on animal language, not only because I think they are cool from a language perspective, but also because I hope that the more people learn about this, the more respect they'll show for animals.
* [Das Kilo für 1,20 Dollar](http://www.zeit.de/2011/45/NDR-Reportage-Altkleider-Luege/komplettansicht)<br/>If you think clothing donations help poor people, you should reconsider. This should be fairly well known by now, but this article (in German) is a good summary of the problems.
* [Voyager 1 hits new region at solar system edge](http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-12-voyager-region-solar-edge.html)<br/>Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 is on the edge of our solar system now.
* [The Spoon Theory](http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory-written-by-christine-miserandino/)<br/>A touching article by a Lupus patient on how she explained her illness to her best friend.
* [Der Breivik aus Traun](http://www.stefanapfl.com/2011/12/07/der-breivik-aus-traun/)<br/>On the same day as Anders Breivik, there also was an Austrian whose hate for foreigners was so great that he decided to kill (in German).
* [Facebook tells India it won’t help censor the Web](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-tells-india-it-wont-help-censor-the-web/5848)<br/>For once some good news related to Facebook.
* [What Really Happened Aboard Air France 447](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/aviation/crashes/what-really-happened-aboard-air-france-447-6611877)<br/>A transcript of the flight recorder with additional information about aviation specifics.
* [17-year-old wins 100k for creating cancer-killing nanoparticle](http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-cetera/17-year-old-wins-100k-for-creating-cancer-killing-nanoparticle-2011128/)<br/>Maybe all this cultural pessimism about "today's youth" is unnecessary?
* [The Rise of Developeronomics](http://www.forbes.com/sites/venkateshrao/2011/12/05/the-rise-of-developeronomics/6/)<br/>According to this rather long Forbes article, it's a real good moment for being a software developer.
* [Party of Swindlers and Thieves](http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2011/12/party-of-swindlers-and-thieves.html)<br/>For people not entirely up to date on Russian issues, this seems to be a good writeup of the recent elections and their meaning.

The progression is the same everywhere: first the people ask, then they demand, then they come and they take.
