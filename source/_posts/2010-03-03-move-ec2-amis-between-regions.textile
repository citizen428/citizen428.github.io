Today I spent some time figuring out how to move <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?creating-an-ami-ebs.html">EBS-backed AMIs</a> between different EC2 regions. To save you the effort, here&#8217;s a quick summary:
<ul>
<li> create a volume from the snapshot backing the AMI</li>
<li> attach this volume to a running instance and mount it</li>
<li> create a new volume in the target region</li>
<li> attach to a running instance, format and mount</li>
<li> in the source region, connect to your instance</li>
<li> rsync (over ssh, so no messing with security groups) the mounted volume to the target volume</li>
<li> once the rsync is done, create a snapshot in the target region</li>
<li> register this snapsho as new AMI with <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/dg/2007-01-03/CLTRG-register.html">ec2-register</a></li>
</ul>

Not rocket science, but definitely not as good as just being able to share your own AMIs between regions...
