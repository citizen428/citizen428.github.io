I recently found a bash snippet which creates a list of the commands in your .bash_history file and how many times you invoked them:

{% codeblock %}
history | awk '{a[$2]++ } END{for(i in a){print a[i] " " i}}'|sort -rn|head
{% endcodeblock %}

Although there was no real point in doing so, I felt the need to write a short Ruby script to do the same:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/117571.js"></script>


Here's the output on my MacBook:
{% codeblock lang:bash %}
$ command_stats | head
time: 75
cd: 68
ls: 66
git: 35
cat: 32
irb: 20
awk: 17
ruby: 15
scala: 15
vim: 12
{% endcodeblock %}

If you are surprised by how many times (no pun intended) I called _time_, it's just because I was benchmarking "Project Euler":http://projecteuler.net/ solutions in several languages, everything else is quite regular (and suggests I don't use the Finder much ;) ).
