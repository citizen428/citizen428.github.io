First off I have to say sorry for being missing in action most of last week without prior notice. But I had to write an article about "Hula":http://hula-project.org/Hula_Server for an Austrian IT magazine.

So far I'm really impressed by this easy to set up and use webmail and calendaring solution, which is exactly what I've been looking for over the last few months. There's a guy called Lachlan Gunn who provides "ebuilds":http://www.users.on.net/~flynne/linux/hula/ for Hula, and who has quickly incorporated the changes I suggested to him. I'm sure he'll also quickly take care of the one I sent him today.

I'm really looking forward to integrate this in our main tree once it matures a little more.
