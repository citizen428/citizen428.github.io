In a little less than four hours, "berq":http:berq.net, "lippi":http://twoday.tuwien.ac.at/perm, "red667":http://red667.org, and me will leave for Berlin where we're going to attend the "23C3":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Home. Since the "Ã–BB":http://oebb.at still sucks, we're once again going by bus, arriving tomorrow at around 6:30am. Judging from last year the time between our arrival until we can check into our "hostel":http://www.hostels.com/en/availability.php/HostelNumber.10594 at around noon will be spent drinking beer, which definitely isn't a recommended breakfast option. Kids, don't try this at home!  

I'm pretty sure we'll once again have loads of fun, and unlike the last years I plan on regularly blogging and posting pics from the event, so stay tuned! Anyone interested in meeting up at the 23C3 either post a comment here or send a mail to my GMail account.
