* [Hot spring yields hybrid genome](http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/04/hot-spring-yields-hybrid-genome.html)<br>This is about a month old, but I finally got around to reading it. Also: a combined RNA+DNA virus, damn.
* [Kodak Had A Secret Nuclear Reactor Loaded With Enriched Uranium Hidden In A Basement](http://gizmodo.com/5909961/kodak-had-a-secret-weapons+grade-nuclear-reactor-hidden-in-a-basement)<br>While "they could have started their own nuclear war if they wanted" is a terrible exaggeration, this is still interesting.
* [Who wants to buy Honduras](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/magazine/who-wants-to-buy-honduras.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all)<br>I'm not sure what to think of this proposed "charter city".
* [The Bizarre History of the Vibrator: From Cleopatra’s Angry Bees to Steam-Powered Dildos](http://gizmodo.com/5909857)<br>A Gizmondo article on a different kind of gadget.
* [5 Gender Stereotypes That Used To Be the Exact Opposite](http://www.cracked.com/article_19780_5-gender-stereotypes-that-used-to-be-exact-opposite.html)<br>Since this is from Cracked.com it's rather light-hearted, but still something you may want to send to people who are too stuck on certain gender roles.
* [The Short, 16-Step Guide to Getting Rid of Your Crap](http://inoveryourhead.net/the-short-16-step-guide-to-getting-rid-of-your-crap/)<br>I've also followed this "own less" approach for a few years now, it's quite liberating.
* [Oracle Goes for Broke in Court Battle With Google](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/google-schmidt-page-damages/)<br>Interesting. Also: coolest judge ever?
* [Gödel and the limits of logic](http://plus.maths.org/content/goumldel-and-limits-logic)<br>A very nice article on Kurt Gödel.
* [Google goes cancer: Researchers use search engine algorithm to find cancer biomarkers](http://esciencenews.com/articles/2012/05/18/google.goes.cancer.researchers.use.search.engine.algorithm.find.cancer.biomarkers)<br>Nice work by TU Dresden.
* [Why Aren't Cities Littered With Dead Pigeons?](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/05/why-arent-cities-littered-dead-pigeons/2038/)<br>This is the sort of question that really needs an answer.
