A couple of days ago I decided that I want to play around with "Rubinius":http://rubini.us, so I cloned the "source":http://github.com/evanphx/rubinius/tree/master from GitHub and thought I was ready to go. As it turned out that wasn't quite the case, since my first attempt to build it ended in the second error can see here:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/77119.js"></script>

I hopped into #rubinius to find out if more people have this problem, but that doesn't seem to be the case. At least I learnt that most active develop is going into the 'stackfull' branch, so I did a 'git checkout origin/stackfull' and gave the build another try, which resulted in the first error message you see above.

Determined not to give up, I decided to try one last time with 'rake vm:clean' and 'rake build:debug' and to my surprise ended up with a working Rubinius install :-)

{% codeblock %}
$ bin/rbx -v
rubinius 0.11.0-dev (ruby 1.8.6) (f5260b581 12/31/2009) [i686-apple-darwin9.6.0]
{% endcodeblock %}

That made me somewhat curious, so I tried 'rake vm:clean' and 'rake build' which now also worked (still can't build master though). I have to admit that I'm slightly confused, but at least I have a working Rubinius version to play around with for the time being.
