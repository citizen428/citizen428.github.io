I'm Michael Kohl from Austria and this is my personal blog.

I currently work as a security auditor and software engineer at [RadarServices Smart IT-Security](http://www.radarservices.eu). I'm also a mentor at [RubyLearning.org](http://www.rubylearning.org/class/) where I started teaching Ruby and Clojure courses in January 2009.

My previous work experience includes [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) development, systems engineering, [devops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) and technical journalism. For more detailed information about my working life please consult my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/citizen428) or [StackOverflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/citizen428) profile.

I'm a big programming language nerd and run a functional programming user group called [Lambdaheads](https://metalab.at/wiki/Lambdaheads) at our local hacker space, the [Metalab](http://metalab.at). I'm also [hopelessly addicted to StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/220147/michael-kohl), but am trying to spend less time on the site nowadays.

Besides all the techy stuff I really enjoy traveling, and so far have visited the following countries:
Bangladesh, Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Laos, Latvia, Malaysia, Nepal, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Vatican

I also lived in China (1 year), Turkey (3 month), Nepal (3 month) and Italy (10 month).

This leads us directly to another hobby of mine, natural languages. My native language is German and I learned English and Italian in school. After that I went on to study Mandarin Chinese at university, attended a 2 month Turkish course in Istanbul and a 2 week Nepali course in Kathmandu. I started studying Swedish in my spare time in late 2010 and am quite happy with my progress. I've also dabbled with Indonesian and Esperanto and can spend hours reading about languages on Wikipedia.
