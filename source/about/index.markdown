I'm Michael Kohl from Austria and this is my personal blog. I currently live in Bangkok (Thailand), where I work as a senior [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) developer for [Oozou](http://oozou.com). I also have work experience in systems engineering, [devops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), security auditing, and technical journalism. For more detailed information about my working life please consult my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/citizen428) or [StackOverflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/citizen428) profiles or have a look at my [projects](/projects) as well as [talks and publications](/talks_and_publications).

I really love traveling and try to do it as often as possible. So far this has brought me to the following places:

Sometimes I like places so much that I end up living there, which so far has happened in in Shanghai (China, 1 year), Istanbul (Turkey, 3 month), Kathmandu (Nepal, 3 month) and Milan (Italy, 10 month).

I'm an avid [CouchSurfer](http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/citizen428/), and regularly contribute to [Wikivoyage](http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Citizen428) and [Trip Advisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/members/citizen428).

This leads us directly to another hobby of mine, natural languages. My native language is German and I learned English and Italian in school. After that I went on to study Mandarin Chinese at university, although I'm not as good at it as I should be. I'm a big fan of Spanish and spending several month in Latin America was a big boost for my skills. Nowadays most of my language learning time is spent on Thai, a language I thoroughly enjoy. Except for the languages already mentioned I also dabbled in Turkish (2 month course in Istanbul), Nepali (2 weeks course in Kathmandu), Swedish, Indonesian and Esperanto.
