I'm Michael Kohl from Austria and this is my personal blog. My work experience includes [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) development, systems engineering, [devops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), security auditing and technical journalism. For more detailed information about my working life please consult my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/citizen428) or [StackOverflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/citizen428) profiles or have a look at my [projects](/projects) as well as [talks and publications](/talks_and_publications). I'm also a mentor at [RubyLearning.org](http://www.rubylearning.org/class/) where I started teaching Ruby and Clojure courses in January 2009.

I'm a big programming language nerd and used to run a functional programming user group called [Lambdaheads](https://metalab.at/wiki/Lambdaheads) at the [Metalab](http://metalab.at). I also was [hopelessly addicted to StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/220147/michael-kohl) for a while, but I'm taking a break from it at the moment.

Besides all the techy stuff I really enjoy traveling, and so far have visited the following countries:

I also lived in Shanghai (China, 1 year), Istanbul (Turkey, 3 month), Kathmandu (Nepal, 3 month) and Milan (Italy, 10 month).

I'm an avid [CouchSurfer](http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/citizen428/), and regularly contribute to [Wikivoyage](http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Citizen428) and [Trip Advisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/members/citizen428).

This leads us directly to another hobby of mine, natural languages. My native language is German and I learned English and Italian in school. After that I went on to study Mandarin Chinese at university, attended a 2 month Turkish course in Istanbul and a 2 week Nepali course in Kathmandu. I started studying Swedish in my spare time in late 2010 and found it to be quite fun. Currently I spend my language learning time exclusively on Spanish, which after several month of traveling in South America and a 2 week course in Buenos Aires is progressing rather well. I've also dabbled with Indonesian and Esperanto and can spend hours reading about languages on Wikipedia.
