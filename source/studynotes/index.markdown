I use Emacs' awesome [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) for taking notes when I work through technical articles, books and videos, as well as for collecting tidbits of information that might come in handy at a later point. A lot of these notes are just for myself, but some of the more complete ones might actually be worth sharing with other people.
