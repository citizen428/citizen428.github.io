    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/07/03/shenanigans</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 1.5 month ago I finally packaged some of my Ruby extension methods into the aptly named <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/shenanigans">Shenanigans</a> gem. It&#8217;s similar to <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/">Facets</a> or <a href="http://as.rubyonrails.org/">ActiveSupport</a>, but probably less useful to most people. Also some of the methods actually are in Facets, although sometimes with different names or slightly different semantics. Anyway, since some people told me they actually do like the gem, here&#8217;s a quick summary of what the different methods do and how they can be useful.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Array:%5E">Array#^</a>: Ruby defines <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/set/rdoc/Set.html#method-i-5E">Set#^</a>, which returns the elements exclusive between the set and a given enum. Since a lot of people use arrays instead of proper sets in Ruby, I found it makes a nice addition to <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html#method-i-7C">Array#|</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html#method-i-26">Array#&amp;</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Array:random_subarray">Array#random_subarray</a>: Generates one or more random subarrays of an array, using the fact that Ruby can index integers to get the bit values to ensure fast uniform distributions. Similar to <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html#method-i-sample">Array#sample</a>, but can generate several subarrays at once.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Array:zip_with">Array#zip_with</a>: The more general form of <code>zip</code> (e.g. in Haskell you could define <code>zip = zipWith (,)</code>). Like Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject">Enumerable#inject</a> it can take a symbol argument or a block, and like Haskell&#8217;s <code>zip</code> it discards excess array elements if one list is shorter than the other, whereas Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html#method-i-zip">Array#zip</a> only does that if the receiver is shorter than the argument (it adds <code>nil</code>s in the other case).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Hash:has_shape%3F">Hash#has_shape?</a>: A quick way to check if a hash&#8217;s keys are of certain classes. This does feel a bit strange in a duck-typed language like Ruby, but someone asked for it on StackOverflow and it was easy enough to write. This could be useful in validations or unit tests though.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Hash:to_ostruct">Hash#to_ostruct</a>: I really like the <a href="https://github.com/railsjedi/rails_config">rails_config</a> gem. I therefore decided to write something that gives me similar functionality (although a lot simpler) for plain Ruby projects. Basically this recursively converts a hash and all nested hashes into <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/ostruct/rdoc/OpenStruct.html">OpenStruct</a> instances. Populate the hash with Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://corelib.rubyonrails.org/classes/YAML.html">YAML</a> support and you have an instant settings object.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Kernel:fn">Kernel#fn</a>: I admit, this was more of a &#8220;because I can&#8221; method. Originally I wrote this so I could compose blocks in <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pointfree">pointfree style</a>, but later added support for <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Proc.html">Proc</a> instances too.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Kernel:prompt">Kernel#prompt</a>: While it&#8217;s great that Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/IO.html#method-i-gets">IO#gets</a> is so general, I always wanted something like Python&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#raw_input">raw_input</a> for command line apps. Additionally you can also automatically call any of the numeric conversions, and I&#8217;m pondering adding support for every unary string method.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Kernel:with">Kernel#with</a>: I think <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-tap">Object#tap</a> is great. However, I sometimes see it used as a replacement for <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject">Enumerable#inject</a> or <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-each_with_object">Enumerable#each_with_object</a>, but for some reason I never really liked the semantics of it. And since I&#8217;m anal about that sort of thing I added this Pascal/ActionScript like <code>with</code> statement.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Object:display">Object#display</a>: Having no proper object-oriented way to print objects in Ruby always kinda bothered me, so I abused <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-tap">Object#tap</a> as a wrapper around <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-puts">Kernel#puts</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-print">Kernel#print</a>. Additionally this is aliased to the name <code>d</code>, which I stole from <a href="https://github.com/janlelis/irbtools">irbtools</a>. The latter form makes it great for debugging method chains and the likes.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Object:it">Object#it</a>: I always disliked blocks of the form <code>{ |x| x }</code> that sometimes crop up when using  <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-group_by">Enumerable#group_by</a> or similar methods. Since Ruby lacks an identity method and <code>id</code> has historically been taken, I decided to name it <code>it</code>.</p></li>

    <updated>2012-06-20T15:05:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/06/20/review-the-tangled-web</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer 1: The good folks of No Starch Press were kind enough to provide me with a review copy of this book, but this did not influence the following text.</em></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer 2: Links to books are Amazon affiliate links.</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been interested in IT security for a long time, but obviously even more so since I started working professionally in this area. Since web applications have become ubiquitous in recent years, they constitute a big part of our penetration testing work. This is a very broad topic, so <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593273886/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=citizen4blog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593273886">The Tangled Web: A Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=citizen4blog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1593273886" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Michal Zalewski is an ambitious project.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was that the book is comparatively thin. At around 300 pages it&#8217;s only about one third of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026470/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=citizen4blog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118026470">The Web Application Hacker&#8217;s Handbook: Finding and Exploiting Security Flaws</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=citizen4blog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1118026470" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Don&#8217;t let that fool you though, this book is not a lightweight by any means. It&#8217;s logically structured in three parts, the first of which explores the various components that constitute the web as we know it today (URLs, HTTP, HTML, CSS etc.) and their security implications. This is followed by a look at the security features — and their shortcomings — of current browsers. After this part 3 deals with current developments and the future of browser and web application security. This is rounded off by a list of common security problems including references to the chapters of the book that cover them, as well as an epilogue with a surprisingly philosophical outlook on IT security and trust in human societies.</p>

<p>The writing was clear and to the point, with tons of footnotes and references to provide the interested reader with the chance to further research the presented topics. The author clearly knows what he&#8217;s talking about and manages to present it in a very approachable way. Due to it&#8217;s limited size the book still has to be a bit dense though, so I never really felt like reading more than one chapter at a time, otherwise it&#8217;d have been to much information to take in at once.</p>

<p>Whether you work in IT security or are a web application developer, this definitely is a book you don&#8217;t want to miss.</p>

    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/06/12/rails-display-branch-in-development-mode</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At work we are building a Rails app that&#8217;s supposed to run on appliances instead of being hosted by us. To make it easier to deal with bug reports and feature requests, we always display the version number in the footer. A couple of days ago I thought it&#8217;d be handy to replace this with the current branch in development mode. Using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/grit">Grit</a> the solution couldn&#8217;t have been any simpler:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>app/helpers/application_helper.rb  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">version_div</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">version</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">development?</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Grit</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Repo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">::</span><span class="no">OurApp</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Application</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Version</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">content_tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:div</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">content_tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:span</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">version</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="ss">:class</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;version&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Call <code>version_div</code> in a view and you are good to go. If dragging in another dev dependency for just one call bothers you, you can also shell out to get the current branch: <code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>.</p>

    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/05/14/tap-dance/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-14T23:14:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/05/14/tap-dance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-tap">Object#tap</a> is a really nice and useful method. One of my favorite uses is <code>Object#d</code>, which I think I originally saw in <a href="https://github.com/janlelis/irbtools">irbtools</a>. Personally, I&#8217;m using the following version in my <code>~/.irbrc</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Object</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">d</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tap</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Inserting this in a chain of calls can be very enlightening as to where a value changes unexpectedly.</p>

<p>However, recently I&#8217;ve seen more and more use of <code>tap</code> where I&#8217;d traditionally have used <code>inject/reduce</code>. People who know me can attest to the fact that I&#8217;m a big fan of the latter, but for some reason there seem to be quite a few developers who find these methods hard to grok. For this reason recent Ruby versions added <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-each_with_object">Enumerable#each_with_object</a>, which seems to be easier to use for some people, but which isn&#8217;t very popular because of it&#8217;s lengthy name. See for example the following blog post that was written as a result of a discussion I had with the author on StackOverflow: <a href="http://phrogz.net/tap-vs-each_with_object">tap vs. each_with_object: tap is faster and less typing.</a></p>

<p>As I said in the comment there, my main problem is that you have to call <code>tap</code> on what is to become the result, not the data you want to transform. While this is not a problem per se, I somehow don&#8217;t like the semantics of it. However, once I decided to hide it behind a Pascal-like <a href="http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/ref/refsu53.html">with statement</a>, I immediately started liking it:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Kernel</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">blk</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">o</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">blk</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here are the examples from the blog post linked above, including a new version for <code>with</code>. Decide which one you like best:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Sure, putting it in <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html">Kernel</a> and therefore calling it without a receiver seems a little strange at first, but I kinda like how it reads. I know this is probably a case of me being anal about semantics, but I really think that <code>with</code> transports the intent a lot better than <code>tap</code> in cases like the one shown here.</p>

    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/05/04/pointless-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m rather fond of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> and also try to apply it to my Ruby coding, at least as long as it doesn&#8217;t become too unidiomatic.</p>

<p>Being at home sick I got bored, so I played around a bit in IRB to create a composition function that will allow me to create higher-order functions in a <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pointfree">pointfree style</a> (sometimes also referred to as &#8220;pointless style&#8221;, hence the title of this post). I know that <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/">Facets</a> has <code>Proc#compose</code> and <code>Proc#*</code>, but they only work with <code>Proc</code> objects. Ruby being the flexible beast that it is, it took me about two minutes to come up with a working solution, which I called <code>fn</code> because it basically returns a function and <code>compose</code> was too long for my taste:</p>

    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/04/18/no-tor/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-18T00:10:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/04/18/no-tor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Update:</em> Server4You rebooted the server into a recovery system for me. I removed the Tor packages and the system is back up again, which means at least the <a href="http://tor.blingblingsquad.net/">mirror</a> is back. I&#8217;d also like to state explicitly that this whole post is based on a single phone conversation with a Server4You support employee, so it&#8217;s hard to tell if the company per se really considers Tor to be illegal in Germany. Personally I think it&#8217;s just a bad excuse for shutting down the service on shared hosts, which is just as bad in my book.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been running a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> relay since sometime in early 2006. There&#8217;s many good reasons for doing so, but what motivated me personally was my experience of studying in China for one year and having to live with a censored Internet connection myself (theoretically, as there was an <a href="http://embraceubuntu.com/2006/12/08/ssh-tunnel-socks-proxy-forwarding-secure-browsing/">easy way around it</a> if you had a server outside of China to SSH to). Alas our system hasn&#8217;t been an exit node in a while, but it&#8217;s still better than nothing.</p>

<p>Today I was contacted by my <a href="http://server4you.de">hosting provider</a>&#8217;s abuse team, telling me that my server has been shut down because of a ToS violation. I <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/citizen428/status/192189329177718784">immediately was afraid</a> that they might complain about the Tor relay, but still had hope that I might be wrong. Ten hours later, after I got no reply to about five support requests, I decided to call their hotline. The employee first told me that he has no way to see why the abuse team blocked my server, but then said that running a Tor node may have been the reason. What ensued was a five minute conversation full of WTFs, facepalms and headdesks on my part, but the bottom line is that Server4You is of the opinion that it is illegal to run a Tor relay in Germany because of the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerparagraf">&#8220;Hackerparagraf&#8221;</a>. If you don&#8217;t know what that is, <a href="http://hackingexpose.blogspot.com/2012/04/watch-out-white-hats-european-union_3977.html">read up</a> on recent pushes to enforce similar legislation EU wide.</p>

<p>After a fruitless discussion of said law, the — admittely nice — guy on the phone reassured me that my server will be restarted if I agree to disable the Tor node. I politely told him that I have no interest in using their services at all if I can&#8217;t use them the way I want to, so I&#8217;ll cancel my contract with Server4You as soon as possible. For the time being I donated some money to Tor, moved my blog over to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (yay <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>) and started evaluating hosting providers in countries with saner legislation (as long as there still are some).</p>

<p>Sure, there&#8217;s probably a lot of really bad things happening over the Tor network, but those shouldn&#8217;t be used to discredit the tool&#8217;s legitimate uses. If we start blaming technology instead of people, we might as well turn off the Internet.</p>
