    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/05/14/tap-dance/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-14T23:14:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/05/14/tap-dance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-tap">Object#tap</a> is a really nice and useful method. One of my favorite uses is <code>Object#d</code>, which I think I originally saw in <a href="https://github.com/janlelis/irbtools">irbtools</a>. Personally, I&#8217;m using the following version in my <code>~/.irbrc</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Object</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">d</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tap</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Inserting this in a chain of calls can be very enlightening as to where a value changes unexpectedly.</p>

<p>However, recently I&#8217;ve seen more and more use of <code>tap</code> where I&#8217;d traditionally have used <code>inject/reduce</code>. People who know me can attest to the fact that I&#8217;m a big fan of the latter, but for some reason there seem to be quite a few developers who find these methods hard to grok. For this reason recent Ruby versions added <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-each_with_object">Enumerable#each_with_object</a>, which seems to be easier to use for some people, but which isn&#8217;t very popular because of it&#8217;s lengthy name. See for example the following blog post that was written as a result of a discussion I had with the author on StackOverflow: <a href="http://phrogz.net/tap-vs-each_with_object">tap vs. each_with_object: tap is faster and less typing.</a></p>

<p>As I said in the comment there, my main problem is that you have to call <code>tap</code> on what is to become the result, not the data you want to transform. While this is not a problem per se, I somehow don&#8217;t like the semantics of it. However, once I decided to hide it behind a Pascal-like <a href="http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/ref/refsu53.html">with statement</a>, I immediately started liking it:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Kernel</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">blk</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">o</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">blk</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here are the examples from the blog post linked above, including a new version for <code>with</code>. Decide which one you like best:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Sure, putting it in <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html">Kernel</a> and therefore calling it without a receiver seems a little strange at first, but I kinda like how it reads. I know this is probably a case of me being anal about semantics, but I really think that <code>with</code> transports the intent a lot better than <code>tap</code> in cases like the one shown here.</p>

    <updated>2012-05-04T13:03:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/05/04/pointless-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m rather fond of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> and also try to apply it to my Ruby coding, at least as long as it doesn&#8217;t become too unidiomatic.</p>

<p>Being at home sick I got bored, so I played around a bit in IRB to create a composition function that will allow me to create higher-order functions in a <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pointfree">pointfree style</a> (sometimes also referred to as &#8220;pointless style&#8221;, hence the title of this post). I know that <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/">Facets</a> has <code>Proc#compose</code> and <code>Proc#*</code>, but they only work with <code>Proc</code> objects. Ruby being the flexible beast that it is, it took me about two minutes to come up with a working solution, which I called <code>fn</code> because it basically returns a function and <code>compose</code> was too long for my taste:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">funs</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Here it is in action:</p>

<p>I know that this isn&#8217;t really shorter than <code>{ |x| x.split.last }</code>, but usefullness isn&#8217;t really the goal of a pointless exercise ;-)</p>

<p>So far so good, but if one doesn&#8217;t really care about pointfree style, wouldn&#8217;t it also be fun to mix and match procs and symbols? It sure would:</p>

    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/04/18/no-tor/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-18T00:10:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/04/18/no-tor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Update:</em> Server4You rebooted the server into a recovery system for me. I removed the Tor packages and the system is back up again, which means at least the <a href="http://tor.blingblingsquad.net/">mirror</a> is back. I&#8217;d also like to state explicitly that this whole post is based on a single phone conversation with a Server4You support employee, so it&#8217;s hard to tell if the company per se really considers Tor to be illegal in Germany. Personally I think it&#8217;s just a bad excuse for shutting down the service on shared hosts, which is just as bad in my book.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been running a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> relay since sometime in early 2006. There&#8217;s many good reasons for doing so, but what motivated me personally was my experience of studying in China for one year and having to live with a censored Internet connection myself (theoretically, as there was an <a href="http://embraceubuntu.com/2006/12/08/ssh-tunnel-socks-proxy-forwarding-secure-browsing/">easy way around it</a> if you had a server outside of China to SSH to). Alas our system hasn&#8217;t been an exit node in a while, but it&#8217;s still better than nothing.</p>

<p>Today I was contacted by my <a href="http://server4you.de">hosting provider</a>&#8217;s abuse team, telling me that my server has been shut down because of a ToS violation. I <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/citizen428/status/192189329177718784">immediately was afraid</a> that they might complain about the Tor relay, but still had hope that I might be wrong. Ten hours later, after I got no reply to about five support requests, I decided to call their hotline. The employee first told me that he has no way to see why the abuse team blocked my server, but then said that running a Tor node may have been the reason. What ensued was a five minute conversation full of WTFs, facepalms and headdesks on my part, but the bottom line is that Server4You is of the opinion that it is illegal to run a Tor relay in Germany because of the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerparagraf">&#8220;Hackerparagraf&#8221;</a>. If you don&#8217;t know what that is, <a href="http://hackingexpose.blogspot.com/2012/04/watch-out-white-hats-european-union_3977.html">read up</a> on recent pushes to enforce similar legislation EU wide.</p>

<p>After a fruitless discussion of said law, the — admittely nice — guy on the phone reassured me that my server will be restarted if I agree to disable the Tor node. I politely told him that I have no interest in using their services at all if I can&#8217;t use them the way I want to, so I&#8217;ll cancel my contract with Server4You as soon as possible. For the time being I donated some money to Tor, moved my blog over to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (yay <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>) and started evaluating hosting providers in countries with saner legislation (as long as there still are some).</p>

<p>Sure, there&#8217;s probably a lot of really bad things happening over the Tor network, but those shouldn&#8217;t be used to discredit the tool&#8217;s legitimate uses. If we start blaming technology instead of people, we might as well turn off the Internet.</p>

    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/02/01/review-a-bug-hunters-diary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very good read! In each chapter the author introduces one bug he found in a popular software package, always following the same structure: discovery, exploitation, remediation, lessons learned from the bug and a timeline of the bug&#8217;s lifetime (disclosure, fix, etc).</p>

<p>The writing is engaging and to the point, but still contains a lot of technical detail. Be warned though, if reading C and disassembly is not your type of thing, you probably won&#8217;t enjoy this too much. The author tries hard to make everything as easy to understand as possible, but there&#8217;s only so much you can do with limited space.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s anything to criticize about this book, it&#8217;s that the chapters are fairly repetitive, so I never really felt like reading more than one in a single sitting. But then it&#8217;s also not the type of book that needs to be read cover to cover as fast as possible.</p>
