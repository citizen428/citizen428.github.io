    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Considering we left Paraguay almost three weeks ago, it&#8217;s a shame I
haven&#8217;t told you anything about this wonderful place yet. But let&#8217;s
backtrack for a second and explore how we got to Paraguay. When we
looked for flights out of Curacao, going to Medellin seemed to be the
most obvious choice, considering the flight with Insel Air is dirt
cheap and takes about an hour. However, obvious choices are boring and
we kinda wanted to work our way up from the South of the continent to
the North, so we started looking into other options like Buenos Aires,
Montevideo or Santiago de Chile. But then I found a reasonably priced
flight to Asunción and given my previous wonderful experience in a
place nobody really goes to (Bangladesh) I started liking the idea. So
I introduced the subject to P. and we decided to go ahead and discover
Paraguay. And I&#8217;m glad we did!</p>

<p>Let me get one thing straight right away: Asunción is not the most
beautiful city in the world. In fact it&#8217;s a bit on the ugly side, at
least around the downtown area. Apparently that&#8217;s because a paranoid
dictator had all tall buildings torn down because he was afraid of
assassins hiding in them, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure that&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s
a pretty good story though. There are some beautiful old colonial
buildings left, but since there&#8217;s not a lot of money to go around,
they are usually in a state of disrepair (or worse). There are however
some nicer modern neighborhoods like Villa Morra where we stayed with
a wonderful CouchSurfing host. Anyway, Asunción&#8217;s a rather relaxed
South American capital, that feels safe and is full of wonderful,
helpful and welcoming people.</p>

<p>People who drink Tereré, all day, every day. Tereré I hear you ask?
It&#8217;s basically like Mate, but made with ice-cold water and generally
with some extra herbs like mint added. It&#8217;s refreshing, delicious, and
since you pass it around it&#8217;s also a wonderful way to spend a couple
of hours with some friends while drinking and chatting. Which we did
quite a bit, for example with our friend Javier who just opened a
beautiful little <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaCasitaDeLaAbuelaHostalVerde">hostel</a> close to Asunción&#8217;s downtown which you
definitely should check out if given the chance! Anyway, for
Paraguayans Tereré is more than just a drink, it&#8217;s an integral part of
their culture and you&#8217;ll see lots of people carrying around a thermos
at all times of day. They also always asked us we already had tried it
and were delighted to find out that we did and that we actually love
it!</p>

<p>Another vivid memory of Asunción are the public buses, which are
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_dB1Xz3aYcZY/SN6diZeTBWI/AAAAAAAAANQ/gZWIsf_86QE/s400/BUS.JPG">colorful</a> and full of people selling all kinds of things (food, drinks,
little knickknacks). Also they don&#8217;t really bother to stop for letting
people get on or off, they just kinda slow down and give you a chance
to practice your Ninja skills.</p>

<p>Now for one of my favorite topics, food: Paraguay was surprisingly ok
for a vegetarian. Not great and I had to eat a lot of carbs, but I
managed. While the modern Paraguayan diet is centered around meat, a
lot of the traditional dishes are vegetarian. This means that I
basically lived off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopa_paraguaya">Sopa Paraguaya</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipa_Guasu">Chipa Guasu</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipa">Chipa</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbeju">Mbeju</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torta_pasqualina">Pasqualina</a>. Fruit juices were ok too, but unfortunately they add sugar to them
unless you stop them, which is common in the region and something I
absolutely don&#8217;t understand. We also cooked quite a bit for ourselves
which was rather nice since supermarkets are quite well-stocked and
carry lots of Italian-style products. They also offer quite a few
different soy-based &#8220;meats&#8221;, which despite not being my favorite way
of eating soy is a rather convenient way to get some protein in your
diet.</p>

<p>Language-wise Paraguay also was rather interesting. While the city
population mostly speak Spanish (more on that later), Guaraní is still
the most common language in rural areas. The local accent was rather
easy to understand, although a lot of people mix in some Guaraní
words. Anyway, it was a good place to improve my listening skills, and
while I&#8217;m still far from being able to hold my own in an interesting
conversation, I&#8217;m definitely improving.</p>

<p>From Asunción we did a day trip to Areguá, a nice little village with
a stunning lake, a beautiful church placed on a picturesque hill and
lots of handicrafts. We stayed in the &#8220;Casa Amarilla&#8221;, which is an old
colonial house that&#8217;s part hostel and part art space and looks like
something out of a David Lynch movie. We also met a couple of nice
Argentinians who not only gave us a lift back to Asunción but also
invited us to stay with them in Corrientes, an offer we might take
them up on next month.</p>

<p>We then moved on to the pretty little border town of Encarnación,
which has a pretty costanera from where you can actually see Posadas
in Argentina. Nearby there are the stunning Jesuit ruins of Trinidad
and Jesús, and since Paraguay isn&#8217;t exactly overrun by tourists, we
basically had them all to ourselves when we went there, which made me
feel a bit like Indiana Jones. Our CouchSurfing host also took us to
Itacua, a famous local religious site, which had some gorgeous views.
He also was kind enough to drive us over the bridge to Argentina,
which made for one of the more interesting border crossings of my
life. The border guard first looked confused when he got two
Paraguayan ID cards, as well as an Austrian and Italian passport, but
then stamped us in without so much as properly looking at us.</p>

<p>I guess that&#8217;s enough for now, I&#8217;ll soon write something about
Northeastern Argentina, where we spent around a week before moving on
to Uruguay from where I&#8217;m currently writing this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a lovely time in Paraguay (a separate post will follow), we explored the Northeast of Argentina a bit (Posadas, San Ignacio,
Iguazu Falls). Today we&#8217;ll take an overnight bus to Colon were we&#8217;ll cross into Paysandu (Uruguay) on Friday or so. We don&#8217;t know how long we&#8217;ll stay there yet, but after that we&#8217;ll head back to Argentina to finally visit some cities.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some pictures for now:</p>

    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/10/20/curacao-curawow/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-20T23:15:00-02:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/10/20/curacao-curawow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last time I promised you all a bit more information about backpacking on a Caribbean island, so here we go: before we set out, we didn&#8217;t exactly know how much time to plan for Curacao, so we decided on 12 days, which also had to do with P.&#8217;s birthday. Considering this island isn&#8217;t too big this seems like a rather long time, but things here are slow, especially when travelling on a budget&#8230;</p>

<p>Take transport for example: unless you rent a car, you depend on the bus system, which mostly consists of white minibuses which you flag down at a &#8220;Bushalte&#8221; (or anywhere else really). You then tell them where to go and they drop you off there, but only after they did the same for all the other passengers who were already on that bus. So it takes time, but kinda works like a taxi since they bring you right to your house. At 3 NAf (around Euro 1.30 or USD 1.70) per ride they are rather expensive, especially for the locals, which you&#8217;ll often just see walking next to the road. Anyway, we got to see a lot of &#8220;real&#8221; Curacao that way, which is cool, but the whole system is a bit unpredictable and waiting for 40 minutes in the scorching midday heat on a Sunday was rather frustrating. There&#8217;s a great quote to remember in situations like this though:</p>

<p>“The traveler sees what he sees, the tourist sees what he has come to see.&#8221; &#8211; G.K. Chesterton</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://moonzroomz.com/">accommodation</a> was rather nice, especially because it&#8217;s more or less the only backpacker place on the island. It&#8217;s not in a particularly good location, since it&#8217;s neither close to the beach nor the town center, but it has a lovely garden, two great dogs, a cute cat and you are bound to meet interesting people here. We were especially lucky with our initial group, since we all got along super well and did all kinds of things together. I found this kinda cool since the youngest member of our gang was 21, while the oldest was 53. This also allowed us to pool our money to rent a car for 3 days, which finally gave us the option to explore some of the nicer beaches in the northwest of the island (Kleine Knip is my favorite, so if you ever make it to Curacao, make sure to check it out). Anyway, you all definitely added a lot to our Curacao experience, so thanks guys!</p>

<p>One thing I really found attractive about Curacao is the mix of languages and cultures. I have a soft spot for creole languages, so I obviously really liked Papiamento. I almost was tempted to attend a course, but I&#8217;ve done enough strange language courses in the past when I got carried away while traveling (Nepali for example). Besides Papiamento there&#8217;s still a lot of Dutch, many people speak English and there are a fair few Chinese and some South Asians around. It&#8217;s this hotchpotch of cultures and the fact that Curacao&#8217;s main industry is not tourism (yet), that make the place rather interesting.</p>

<p>Considering how long this mail already is, it&#8217;s rather surprising that I haven&#8217;t talked about one of my favorite topics yet: food! The local cuisine is an interesting mix of various cooking traditions, with Dutch things like Kroket and Bitterballen next to more Caribbean fare like Papaya stew, plantains and obviously loads of seafood . On top of that there are many Chinese takeout places referred to as &#8220;Snacks&#8221;, which serve decent but rather uninspired staples like fried rice and noodles. Compared to many of the other options they are rather cheap though, so they became a regular contributor to our diet. They also serve a lot of vegetarian food, which made my life considerably easier, although I have to say that while the local cuisine is rather meat heavy, people were generally very helpful and considerate and just made up vegetarian dishes on the fly for me, which is more than can be said for a lot of other places. Last but not least there&#8217;s also quite a few Surinamese restaurants and &#8220;roti shops&#8221;, and although we only got to try one, I have to say we instantly became fans (veggies and roti, what&#8217;s not to like?).</p>

<p>So, how to sum up our Curacao experience? Overall, it was a pretty good and enjoyable stay. The Caribbean is not Asia, so on a backpacker&#8217;s budget it may not be easy to have that perfect lazy beach holiday. Especially compared to Thailand or Malaysia, where 15 Euro per day gets me all the luxury I need, meaning a decent room in a nice place and good food. On Curacao the same was closer to 40-45 Euro per day (including the 3 days of shared rental car), which is a bit steep for the kind of journey we are on. But after a rather stressful period in Vienna we both needed to wind down, so this was a bit like a little holiday before the actual trip. Besides that the pleasant weather, perfect sea and beaches and the interesting cultural mix definitely made it a worthwhile stay.</p>

<p>Would I recommend this place? If you are willing to spend a bit, definitely. Compared to neighboring Aruba it&#8217;s actually pretty cheap, but if you are on a budget, your perspective changes. A car definitely is a worthwhile investment, so if money&#8217;s tight, try to find people to team up with, even if it&#8217;s just for a couple of days. Also, if you do wanna spoil yourself, invest in a trip to Klein Curacao! Granted, 75 Euro for a day trip is quite the investment when you are traveling for a long time, but a couple of hours on an uninhabited Caribbean island were definitely worth it in my book.</p>

<p>The next mail will probably be about Paraguay (which is where arrived last Sunday), so stay tuned!</p>

    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/10/12/bon-bini/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-12T17:55:00-02:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/10/12/bon-bini</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This was originally written on October 6th as an email, but I only got around to modify and post it here now.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Bon bini&#8221; means &#8220;welcome&#8221; in Papiamento, the creole language of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_islands_(Lesser_Antilles)">ABC islands</a>, which seems fitting, since I&#8217;m writing this from Curaçao.
Yes, that&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m in the Caribbean right now. But more on that
later&#8230;</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning: I&#8217;m happily unemployed and homeless
again, which can only mean one thing: prolonged travelling! Before
anyone wonders, &#8220;I&#8221; is still a &#8220;we&#8221; and P. is somewhere around here, I
promise.</p>

<p>Back to the present: our first destination on this trip is Curaçao,
mostly because we found a really cheap one-way flight with Air Berlin,
which in my book is a rather good reason to go almost anywhere (except
for you, Dubai, I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll never be friends). Except for the 45
minute delay the flight via Duesseldorf was rather uneventful,
although the lack of in-seat IFE combined with slightly annoying
neighbors made the almost 10 hours seem somewhat longer. Anyway, we
got here safe and sound on October 2nd, met some really cool people right
away and have been happily idling away the last couple of days.
Unfortunately two of our new friends already moved on to Columbia, but
the remaining four of our little hostel family are holding up bravely
and are going to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_Cura%C3%A7ao">Klein Curaçao</a> tomorrow as consolation.</p>

<p>We have a flight to Paraguay on October 14th, and while 11 days on
Curaçao may seem like stretching it a bit, this is a much-needed break
after a rather stressful period back in Vienna.</p>

<p>Since we only got here a couple of days ago it&#8217;s too
early for any profound observations, but expect more impressions of
backpacking on a Caribbean island in the next post.</p>

    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/07/30/ruby-left-section-for-infix-operators/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-30T23:24:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/07/30/ruby-left-section-for-infix-operators</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let me admit right away that this is yet another &#8220;because I can&#8221; type of post with little practical use. With that out of the way, today&#8217;s topic is <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Section_of_an_infix_operator">sections of infix operators</a> as known from e.g. Haskell. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="err">λ</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">map</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you can see the function to be <code>map</code>ped is specified with the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Partial_application">partially applied</a> function <code>(2+)</code> (or <code>(+2)</code> for that matter).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how we would have to write the same code in Ruby:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This could also be written in a <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pointfree">pointfree</a> way, but alas that would make the code rather hard to understand for less experienced Rubyists:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">method</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:+</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But because Ruby is as flexible as it is, adding partial application is actually really trivial:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Fixnum</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">alias</span> <span class="ss">:add</span> <span class="ss">:+</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">+</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">o</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">self</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And now we can do this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">+</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; [3, 4, 5]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Not too bad I think and rather consistent with Ruby&#8217;s overall style. Alas I don&#8217;t think we are likely to see partial application on a language level any time soon though&#8230;</p>

    <updated>2012-07-28T10:15:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/07/28/review-ruby-and-mongodb-web-development</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I was one of the technical editors of this book, so I may be biased.</p>

<p>While I haven&#8217;t received <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/ruby-and-mongodb-web-development-beginners-guide/book">the book</a> in its final form yet, I&#8217;ve read all of it, and I can say that the author does a good job at introducing inexperienced programmers to web development with Ruby and MongoDB.</p>

<p>This is a hands-on book and you&#8217;ll get most out of it by following all the exercises and doing them on your own. From getting all the necessary components and installing them, to developing apps with Sinatra and Rails, a lot of ground is covered.</p>

<p>While the author does tackle some more advanced topics, they are clearly not the focus of this book (it&#8217;s subtitled &#8220;Beginner&#8217;s Guide&#8221; for a reason) which will leave more experienced developers wanting for more. However, the presented material is well written, chapters build on each other and if you are new to web development with Ruby/RoR and/or MongoDB, this is a good title to get you up to speed in just 300 pages.</p>

<p>If you are a more experienced Ruby developer or are already very familiar with MongoDB, this is probably not the book for you, even though you&#8217;ll probably still get something out of it.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-03T19:46:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/07/03/shenanigans</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 1.5 month ago I finally packaged some of my Ruby extension methods into the aptly named <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/shenanigans">Shenanigans</a> gem. It&#8217;s similar to <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/">Facets</a> or <a href="http://as.rubyonrails.org/">ActiveSupport</a>, but probably less useful to most people. Also some of the methods actually are in Facets, although sometimes with different names or slightly different semantics. Anyway, since some people told me they actually do like the gem, here&#8217;s a quick summary of what the different methods do and how they can be useful.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Array:%5E">Array#^</a>: Ruby defines <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/set/rdoc/Set.html#method-i-5E">Set#^</a>, which returns the elements exclusive between the set and a given enum. Since a lot of people use arrays instead of proper sets in Ruby, I found it makes a nice addition to <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html#method-i-7C">Array#|</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html#method-i-26">Array#&amp;</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Array:random_subarray">Array#random_subarray</a>: Generates one or more random subarrays of an array, using the fact that Ruby can index integers to get the bit values to ensure fast uniform distributions. Similar to <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html#method-i-sample">Array#sample</a>, but can generate several subarrays at once.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Array:zip_with">Array#zip_with</a>: The more general form of <code>zip</code> (e.g. in Haskell you could define <code>zip = zipWith (,)</code>). Like Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject">Enumerable#inject</a> it can take a symbol argument or a block, and like Haskell&#8217;s <code>zip</code> it discards excess array elements if one list is shorter than the other, whereas Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html#method-i-zip">Array#zip</a> only does that if the receiver is shorter than the argument (it adds <code>nil</code>s in the other case).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Hash:has_shape%3F">Hash#has_shape?</a>: A quick way to check if a hash&#8217;s keys are of certain classes. This does feel a bit strange in a duck-typed language like Ruby, but someone asked for it on StackOverflow and it was easy enough to write. This could be useful in validations or unit tests though.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Hash:to_ostruct">Hash#to_ostruct</a>: I really like the <a href="https://github.com/railsjedi/rails_config">rails_config</a> gem. I therefore decided to write something that gives me similar functionality (although a lot simpler) for plain Ruby projects. Basically this recursively converts a hash and all nested hashes into <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/ostruct/rdoc/OpenStruct.html">OpenStruct</a> instances. Populate the hash with Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://corelib.rubyonrails.org/classes/YAML.html">YAML</a> support and you have an instant settings object.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Kernel:fn">Kernel#fn</a>: I admit, this was more of a &#8220;because I can&#8221; method. Originally I wrote this so I could compose blocks in <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pointfree">pointfree style</a>, but later added support for <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Proc.html">Proc</a> instances too.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Kernel:prompt">Kernel#prompt</a>: While it&#8217;s great that Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/IO.html#method-i-gets">IO#gets</a> is so general, I always wanted something like Python&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#raw_input">raw_input</a> for command line apps. Additionally you can also automatically call any of the numeric conversions, and I&#8217;m pondering adding support for every unary string method.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Kernel:with">Kernel#with</a>: I think <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-tap">Object#tap</a> is great. However, I sometimes see it used as a replacement for <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject">Enumerable#inject</a> or <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-each_with_object">Enumerable#each_with_object</a>, but for some reason I never really liked the semantics of it. And since I&#8217;m anal about that sort of thing I added this Pascal/ActionScript like <code>with</code> statement.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Object:display">Object#display</a>: Having no proper object-oriented way to print objects in Ruby always kinda bothered me, so I abused <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-tap">Object#tap</a> as a wrapper around <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-puts">Kernel#puts</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-print">Kernel#print</a>. Additionally this is aliased to the name <code>d</code>, which I stole from <a href="https://github.com/janlelis/irbtools">irbtools</a>. The latter form makes it great for debugging method chains and the likes.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/shenanigans/1.0.4/Object:it">Object#it</a>: I always disliked blocks of the form <code>{ |x| x }</code> that sometimes crop up when using  <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-group_by">Enumerable#group_by</a> or similar methods. Since Ruby lacks an identity method and <code>id</code> has historically been taken, I decided to name it <code>it</code>.</p></li>
