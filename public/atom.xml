    <link href="http://www.citizen428.net/blog/2015/03/13/review-programming-elixir/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-13T22:32:51+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.citizen428.net/blog/2015/03/13/review-programming-elixir</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The good folks at <a href="https://pragprog.com/">The Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> were nice enough to provide me with a free copy of this book, but this has no influence on the contents of the review.</em></p>

<p>My first contact with Dave Thomas was the famous &ldquo;<a href="https://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby">Pickaxe book</a>&rdquo; for Ruby. It wasn&rsquo;t my first contact with the language, but it certainly helped in deepening my understanding of it. It&rsquo;s a great book, and I went back numerous times to re-read certain chapters. I already had a crush on Ruby, but &ldquo;the Pickaxe&rdquo; helped turning that into a solid and lasting love affair.</p>

<p>Fast-forward some years. While I still love Ruby and work with it professionally, I have to admit to having a new language crush: <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. I&rsquo;ve been interested in Erlang for several years, read some books, dabbled a bit, but never really got into the language. Elixir however got me hooked almost from the get-go. I find it&rsquo;s a simple, elegant language, that&rsquo;s easy to pick up, but has quite some depth.</p>

<h3>The book</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start off by clearly stating what this book is not: a reference. It weighs in at around 340 pages and does not try to cover every aspect of Elixir/Erlang. It still is one of my all-time favorite programming books though. Why? Because I believe it does an amazing job in conveying the &ldquo;essence&rdquo; of Elixir. There&rsquo;s no point in documenting APIs, the language has <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs.html">great documentation online</a>. Instead Dave tries to teach the reader how to think in Elixir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Programming Elixir&rdquo; has three main parts. The first called &ldquo;Conventional Programming&rdquo; introduces some core concepts like pattern matching and immutability, before covering Elixir types, functions, modules, language constructs, and project organization. It&rsquo;s easy to read, but not too boring for seasoned developers. However, if you have some previous experience with Elixir, Erlang, or even some other functional programming language you may end up skimming this section a bit, at least I did.</p>

<p>Where it starts to get really interesting is the next part called &ldquo;Concurrent Programming&rdquo;, which covers processes, nodes and the basics of OTP. This latter part can easily fill books of its own, so the author only manages to cover some <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ.html">behaviours</a>, like servers (<em>gen_server</em> to be specific), supervisors and applications. It&rsquo;s some excellent material however, so unless you&rsquo;re a seasoned Erlang developer this part alone could be reason enough to read this book. Sure, it would have been great to go into some more detail or cover more of OTP, but I think it&rsquo;s more than enough to make people understand the core principles of the framework so they are able to continue their studies with a solid foundation. I&rsquo;ve seen many people struggle with the concept of processes and message passing concurrency, despite the relative simplicity of the <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Actor_model">Actor model</a>. But when Dave suggests thinking of processes somewhat like objects in the sense that they encapsulate state, sending messages suddenly will feel very familiar to OO programmers who find it hard to structure their code around Elixir/Erlang semantics.</p>

<p>Last but not least there&rsquo;s &ldquo;More Advanced Elixir&rdquo;, which covers macros, protocols, the language&rsquo;s approach to mixins and a grab bag of topics that didn&rsquo;t quite warrant chapters of their own. I really liked this entire section, especially the parts on protocols and mixins. I feel like it gave me the tools to look at most Elixir code and figure out what&rsquo;s happening, which is quite an achievement for a book of this length.</p>

<h3>Closing thoughts</h3>

<p>The world of Erlang/OTP is somewhat different from other programming languages, so no matter what your background is, chances are that certain things may feel somewhat alien to you. This is were &ldquo;Programming Elixir&rdquo; shines: it doesn&rsquo;t just try to get you to write Elixir, it wants you to write good idiomatic code because you understand what makes the language tick. The writing has a good flow and is to the point. On top of that each chapter comes with some well thought-out exercises that should keep motivated readers busy for a while. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a better introduction to the language than &ldquo;Programming Elixir&rdquo;, highly recommended!</p>

No news here, but may be interesting for people not aware of the situation in SE Asian prisons.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.siliconafrica.com/dont-call-them-expats-they-are-immigrants-like-everyone-else/">Don’t Call them Expats, They are Immigrants like Everyone Else</a><br>
For me: expat = sent abroad by company, getting bonuses etc. for working abroad. Everyone else, myself included, is a foreign worker/migrant. In a discussion on Facebook however someone mentioned the following, which strikes me as true: moving from richer to poorer country = expat. Moving from poorer to richer country = migrant.</li>

&ldquo;A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one&rsquo;s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.&rdquo; — George Orwell, 1984</li>

    <link href="http://www.citizen428.net/blog/2014/08/17/re-kindling-my-love-affair-with-the-kindle-fire/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-17T18:19:31+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.citizen428.net/blog/2014/08/17/re-kindling-my-love-affair-with-the-kindle-fire</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I originally bought my Kindle Fire HD 7&#8221;, I was madly in love with it. However, after the initial euphoria was over, I got very annoyed with the dumbed down user interface and the limited availability of apps in Amazon&rsquo;s app store.</p>

<p>So yesterday morning I finally set aside around 2 hours to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Root the device (<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2074565">How To: Root the Kindle Fire 7&#8221; HD or 2 with Linux/MAC</a>)</li>
<li>Install Google Play (<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2069329">Install Google Play Store Noob (Simple) Version</a>)</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://novalauncher.com/">Nova Launcher</a> (<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1955586">Nova Launcher on the KFHD7!</a>)</li>
<li>Disable OTA updates (<a href="http://androidcowboy.com/2013/06/how-to-disable-amazon-ota-updates/">How to Disable Amazon OTA Updates</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>All in all the process went pretty smoothly and I now I have a mostly uncrippled Android tablet. There are some small glitches, but they are certainly less annoying than having a very limited device. At first I couldn&rsquo;t get the Kindle app to run (it&rsquo;s a modified version that&rsquo;s pretty tied to the Fire&rsquo;s native launcher), but after a bit of fiddling around it&rsquo;s now working. Some people also opt for not selecting any launcher as default action for the home button, so they can easily switch between the Kindle experience and a more tablet like launcher.</p>

<p>If you own a Kindle Fire that you don&rsquo;t use much maybe you should give rooting a try, it may re-kindle your interest in the device.</p>

    <link href="http://www.citizen428.net/blog/2014/05/08/vcr/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-08T22:32:55+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.citizen428.net/blog/2014/05/08/vcr</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I spent quite some time on a rather hard to track down problem. I had some specs using <a href="">VCR</a>, which worked perfectly locally, but just wouldn&rsquo;t run on <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a>. In fact, it seemed like CircleCI didn&rsquo;t in fact use the VCR cassettes at all, but instead make a real API call, which failed because the necessary credentials weren&rsquo;t available in the environment (which was kinda the point of using VCR in the first place).</p>

<p>Turns out the problem lay in the combination of using the VCR setting <code>configure_rspec_metadata!</code> and the option <code>core.ignorecase = true</code>, which is standard in newer versions of <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. What happened was that at one point I changed the case of a word in a test description, which changes the auto-generated name of the folder VCR will create the cassette in. But since the folder name wasn&rsquo;t changed from git&rsquo;s perspective, I never realized that. So when the code was checked out on CircleCI, VCR encountered the spec with the metadata (<code>vcr: true</code>), but couldn&rsquo;t find the cassette since the checked out folder had the wrong case. It therefore proceeded to run the spec against the live API which failed.</p>

<p>All in all this cost me about 1.5 hours, and I only managed to find a solution thanks to a helpful colleague and CircleCI&rsquo;s option of letting you SSH into the machine the tests run on, which is how we discovered the second folder that was created.</p>

<p>TIL that git&rsquo;s not case-sensitive. I&rsquo;d rather have found out another way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Same post as every year, here are the book I read last year. However, this time around there are several novelties: first off, my Spanish got good enough to actually read books, so there are 3 languages now (English, German, Spanish). Also my Kindle Fire allowed me to get back into comics, so I (re-)read a lot of the classics and great stuff I missed out on over the years. Last but not least this is also the year where I started listening to audiobooks, mostly because they are really practical on long bus journeys because they keep you occupied but you can still enjoy the landscape.</p>
