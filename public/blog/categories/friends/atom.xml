    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Step 1. Be bored at worked.
Step 2. Get attracted by a <a href="http://www1.skyeurope.com/en/ commercial">discount airline</a>'s commercial in your favorite online newspaper.
Step 3. Discover that flights to "Bucharest":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest are incredibly cheap and decide to go there for a weekend in April.
Step 4. This is the crucial step: Don't pay attention while booking the flight and choose the wrong date for your return flight, so you end up booking 1,5 weeks in Romania.</p>

<p>Summary: "Christian":http://luchmhor.net and me will go to Romania from April 20th until April 30th. Wish us luck/fun/whatever.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a little less than four hours, "berq":http:berq.net, "lippi":http://twoday.tuwien.ac.at/perm, "red667":http://red667.org, and me will leave for Berlin where we're going to attend the "23C3":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Home. Since the "Ã–BB":http://oebb.at still sucks, we're once again going by bus, arriving tomorrow at around 6:30am. Judging from last year the time between our arrival until we can check into our "hostel":http://www.hostels.com/en/availability.php/HostelNumber.10594 at around noon will be spent drinking beer, which definitely isn't a recommended breakfast option. Kids, don't try this at home!</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure we'll once again have loads of fun, and unlike the last years I plan on regularly blogging and posting pics from the event, so stay tuned! Anyone interested in meeting up at the 23C3 either post a comment here or send a mail to my GMail account.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Saturday, February 18:</em>
"teemow":http://www.teemow.de and "Steffi":http://flickr.com/photos/peppertwin/ came from Cologne to Vienna. Spent the night at "B72":http://b72.at/, "Chelsea":http://www.chelsea.co.at/ and "Elektro Gönner":http://www.elektro-g.at/. Nice.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, February 19:</em>
Had a decent brunch with my girlfriend at "Restaurant Leopold":http://www.restaurant-leopold.at/. Then had some coffee at the "Bluebox":http://www.bluebox.at/ with teemow, Steffi and Laki. The "Coheed and Cambrea" concert in the evening got postponed again, so I went to the "Einhorn" with my former flatmate Doris to have some beers...</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, February 21:</em>
Attended the IT Suppliers Day of one of our customers. Went to Laki's place with my girlfriend in the evening to have some Caipiroskas with him, teemow and Steffi.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday, February 22:</em>
Met my co-conspirators (details to follow) "berq":http://berq.net/blog/ and "colo":http://gnulords.org/~colo/serendipity/ (who now has a blog too) at the Käuzchen. Got drunk again, but it was definitely worth it... ;)</p>

<p><em>Friday, February 24:</em>
Had some great lunch - Seafood Soup and Walleye In White Wine Sauce - at Alberto's with my boss and the "WCM":http://www.wcm.at guys. I'll do a nice article series for them starting in June. More info will follow.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, February 25:</em>
Went to the office for a workshop (around 2,5 hours), which was actually pretty informative and nice. Started reading "The Cocka Hola Company":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/3453400526/026-7600414-8433267 and love it.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, February 26:</em>
Had brunch with Karin and Andi at the "Lux":http://lokaltipp.at/lokale/homepage_9_1034, which IMHO offers one of the best breakfast deals in town (all you can eat buffet with <em>great</em> antipasti and lots of other good stuff for Euro 8,40!). Highly recommended!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've been to the Depeche Mode concert in the "Wiener Stadthalle":http://stadthalle.at last Thursday. Although it was quite nice, concerts this big definitely aren't my thing. They are more like Hollywood movies: good while they last, but nothing life changing or overly surprising. I much more enjoy small Punk or Hardcore concerts, where you can have a beer and a nice chat with the band afterwards and generally feel much more involved...</p>

<p>"teemow":http://teemow.com/ and his girlfriend are going to stay in Vienna for a few days, so I guess we'll go out partying tonight which should be good fun! :)</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'll have brunch at "Restaurant Leopold":http://www.restaurant-leopold.at/ with my girlfriend and will go to see "JR Ewing":http://www.thejrewing.com/ and "Coheed and Cambria":http://www.coheedandcambria.com/ in the "Arena Wien":http://www.arena.co.at/ with my former flatmate.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday evening "m3's":http://www.leyrer.priv.at/martin/ girlfriend "Susanne":http://www.webcave.at/ organized a little surprise dinner at "mas":http://www.pancho.at/mas/index.htm to celebrate Martin's 35th birthday, which was really relaxing and entertaing. :) It was just what I needed after a rather unnerving day at university, and it really made me look forward to my other "social events" this week (the monthly "AGLUG":http://www.aglug.net/ meeting on Thursday and another "Pardus":http://pardus.at/ meetup on Saturday).</p>

<p>Today was my second day in my new job, which I mostly spent on heartbeat scripts and a "funny" server which shows some irritating behavior. I also had to build my first deb package for the deployment of some in-house software, and I have to say that I now love Portage more than ever... ;)</p>
