    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>"Solar power goes viral":http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/solar-virus-0425.html<br>A genetically modified virus increases the efficiency of solar cells.</li>
<li>"Digging Deeper":http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=5078<br>In a time where it seems like a lot of journalists just seem to copy whatever they find online, it's refreshing when a journalist from a small newspaper - who above all is a science and data geek - wins a Pulitzer Price.</li>
<li>"Guantanamo leaks lift lid on world's most controversial prison":http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-lift-lid-prison<br>The Guardian covers the Guantanamo leaks, Including a "video":http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-bay-files-reprieve-video interview with Clive Stafford Smith, legal director of Reprieve, as well as an "interactive presentation":http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-guantanamo-bay of all the prisoners' files.</li>
<li>"Eating Healthily for $3 a Day":http://www.miketuritzin.com/writing/eating-healthily-for-3-a-day/<br>Bad eating habits are quite common in the hacker community, so I decided to include this link. For me the main problem when it comes to healthy eating is having to work, but even there you can manage without too much overhead.</li>
<li>"Richard Feynman on education in Brazil":http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education<br>A good read. During my academic life I met enough people who considered memorizing more important than understanding.</li>
<li>"The Consequentialist":http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/05/02/110502fa_fact_lizza?printable=true<br>A very long and detailed article by the New Yorker that helps better understand the Obama administration's foreign policy.</li>
<li>"Amazon's $23,698,655.93 book about flies":http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=358<br>On the wonders of algorithmic pricing.</li>
<li>"LSD: The Geek's Wonder Drug?":http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/01/70015?currentPage=1<br>This article is already 5 years old and I feel we still haven't moved forward in rehabilitating certain drugs and using them for good.</li>
<li>"The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming":http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming.html<br>Another article from 2006, but still as true today as it was back then.</li>
<li>"Programming may one day be about getting the maths right":http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/0429/1224295670955.html?via=mr<br>Yes, I'm an FP aficionado, so what? ;-)</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being sick this week I had a lot of time to read, but most if it went into Bruce Sterling's "Hacker Crackdown":http://www.mit.edu/hacker/hacker.html and Joe Dunthorne's "Submarine":http://www.amazon.com/Submarine-Joe-Dunthorne/dp/0241143969. Anyway, here we go:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Did 'Star Wars' become a toy story? ":http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/08/12/star-wars-was-born-a-long-time-ago-but-not-all-that-far-far-away-in-1972-filmmakers-george-lucas-and-gary-kurtz-wer/<br>I admit to being quite a Star Wars nerd, the "Han shot first":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_shot_first kind who pretends Episode I-III never happened and who actually sat through the entire "Holiday special":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Wars_Holiday_Special. If you are remotely like me, this article providing some insider information by "Gary Kurtz":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kurtz will be quite an interesting read.</li>
<li>"Computers and Mathematical Notation":http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/camn.htm<br>Interesting thoughts on how programming languages (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language">J</a> in this case) could influence mathematical notation by Turing Award winner "Kenneth E. Iverson":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson</li>
<li>"Common Programmer Health Problems":http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1281257293.html<br>Some sane advice we all occasionally are guilty of ignoring.</li>
<li>"We Are All Talk Radio Hosts":http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/08/we-are-all-talk-radio-hosts/<br>On strawberry jam, reasoning and cognitive bias.</li>
<li>"The Millennium Development Goal that really does work has been forgotten":http://aidwatchers.com/2010/09/the-millennium-development-goal-that-really-does-work-has-been-forgotten/<br>Sure, we'll help you. Just not in a way so that you eventually can help yourself.</li>
<li>"The Anthropology of Hackers":http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/09/the-anthropology-of-hackers/63308/<br>Outline of anthropologist Gabriella Coleman's course about hacker culture at NYU.</li>
<li>"Ten things to look for in a circumvention tool":https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ten-things-look-circumvention-tool<br>By Roger Dingledine of Tor fame.</li>
<li>"This Ain't Your Daddy's Wumpus":http://nostarch.com/download/Lisp08.pdf<br>Example chapter from the upcoming book "Land of Lisp":http://nostarch.com/lisp.htm (PDF).</li>
<li>"In Arabian Desert, a Sustainable City Rises":http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/arts/design/26masdar.html?_r=1&hp<br>The first residents are starting to move into "Masdar":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masdar_City, a planned city built in Abu Dhabi. There seems to be some discussion about how much of a "real" city Masdar will be, but then Dubai didn't feel like a "real" place to me either, but more like a soulless agglomeration of skyscrapers and shopping malls.</li>
</ul>
