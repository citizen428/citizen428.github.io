    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You probably don&rsquo;t want to know what I&rsquo;ve been up to lately, but mean bastard that I am, I&rsquo;m going to tell you anyway.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday:</em> Watched another Chinese movie at the &ldquo;Viennale&rdquo;:<a href="http://viennale.at/,">http://viennale.at/,</a> which was called &ldquo;Hong Yan&rdquo;:<a href="http://viennale.at/en/programm/filme/1869.shtml.">http://viennale.at/en/programm/filme/1869.shtml.</a> If you like quiet movies which tell simple stories, this one definitely is a good choice. I liked it quite a lot, so I really recommend you try to see this one!</p>

<p><em>Thursday:</em> My girl friend and me had lunch at the &ldquo;Wiener Deewan&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.falter.at/web/wwei/detail.php?nr=5266&amp;ref=">http://www.falter.at/web/wwei/detail.php?nr=5266&amp;ref=</a>(strasse%3Dliechtenstein%26bezirk%3D9%26teil%3D1, which is located in Vienna&rsquo;s 9th district. It&rsquo;s a nice small restaurant with Indian/Pakistani food, which has a unique concept: All you can eat, pay what you want! Really! They have several  great curries, salad and bread. Quite a lot of dishes are vegetarian, and everything&rsquo;s delicious. And although the drinks sell for fixed prices and are not included in the &ldquo;pay what you want&rdquo;, you get free tap water with the food, so you don&rsquo;t feel obliged to order drinks. The &ldquo;dal&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daal">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daal</a> is fantastic, as are the other vegetarian dishes and the lamb curry. The restaurant itself is small and packed, which together with the intersting mix of people adds up to a nice and relaxed athmosphere. Definitely a good place to go if you are in Vienna and dig Indian food!</p>

<p><em>Friday:</em> Football! Went to Parndorf to watch the Sportklub game, which we lost 4:0. Later we collectively tried hard to erase our memories of that game, and I somehow ended up in a strange location I&rsquo;ve never been before, watching a Russian/American surf punk band called &ldquo;The Jancee Pornick Casino&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.janceewarnick.com/.">http://www.janceewarnick.com/.</a> Here&rsquo;s a little info from their web site: <i>The trio calls their own style Las Vegas-punk and Russian surf, but there are many more ingredients like rockabilly, beat music and even 60&rsquo;s elevator music, all being laced with a good jug of good-hearted Russian humor making the Pornick sound so vivid and unique. These are some wild boys but, man, they can also play their instruments!</i> Unfortunately we came rather late and only saw the last few songs, but the gig was pretty cool and I&rsquo;ll probably buy one or two of their CDs once I have money again&hellip; (Hint: If you now feel a strange urge to buy me one now, I surely won&rsquo;t stop you!)</p>

<p><em>Saturday:</em> On Saturday my friend &ldquo;Steve&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.cargal.org/drupal/index.php">http://www.cargal.org/drupal/index.php</a> decided that Salzburg is way too boring, so he came to Vienna to visit museums, meet friends and for generally having a good time. We had food and some beers at the &ldquo;Blue Box&rdquo;:<a href="http://bluebox.at,">http://bluebox.at,</a> before moving on to the Xeno, where I finish off a lot of my nights out with a last beer on my way home&hellip; It was a relaxed and nice evening, especially since I hadn&rsquo;t seen Steve for quite some time before this.</p>

<p><em>Sunday:</em> I&rsquo;m sure that like most other days Sunday had a morning and afternoon as well, but I only remember watching TV in the evening and listening to the first episode of Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s new podcast, &ldquo;When Sysadmins Ruled the World&rdquo;:<a href="http://craphound.com/000547.html.">http://craphound.com/000547.html.</a> It&rsquo;s really great and I can&rsquo;t wait to hear the next episode, so I definitely recommend this to you my fellow geeks and nerds!</p>

<p><em>Monday:</em> Went to the &ldquo;Big Time International Pub&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.bigtime.at/">http://www.bigtime.at/</a> where some Austrian &ldquo;Pardus&rdquo;:<a href="http://pardus.at">http://pardus.at</a> players had a little meetup. All in all there were 8 people, we had some beer, talked a lot about the game and generally had a good time. You still don&rsquo;t play Pardus yet? Well, then you certainly should start!</p>

<p><em>Tuesday:</em> Nothing special. Did some long overdue university stuff, hung out in the Pardus alliance chat and watched 3sat for the whole day. They have a China special going on, so it&rsquo;s 24 hours of documentaries and movies about the &ldquo;Middle Kingdom&rdquo;. Some of this has been quite interesting, and how often do you get a chance to claim watching TV is related to university?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also played around with some technical stuff and found a really nice project I hardly can wait to tell you about, but I&rsquo;ll leave that for another blog. I&rsquo;ll now try to find out what happened to the last few hours, because I just noticed it&rsquo;s close to 9:30pm already and it only feels like 6:30 or something&hellip; Oh, before I forget it: I added a &ldquo;ClustrMap&rdquo;:<a href="http://clustrmaps.com/counter/maps.php?url=http://citizen428.net">http://clustrmaps.com/counter/maps.php?url=http://citizen428.net</a> to my blog&rsquo;s sidebar, so that from now on I can check from where in the world my blog gets read. South America and Africa don&rsquo;t seem to be particularly interested in what I write, which makes the kittens sad. And does nobody around here ever think about the children?*</p>

<p><I>Disclaimer: I neither have children nor kittens, but I didn&rsquo;t want to drag Baby Jesus into this mess. If I would he&rsquo;d be crying though&hellip;</i></p>
