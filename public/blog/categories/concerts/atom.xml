    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've been to the Depeche Mode concert in the "Wiener Stadthalle":http://stadthalle.at last Thursday. Although it was quite nice, concerts this big definitely aren't my thing. They are more like Hollywood movies: good while they last, but nothing life changing or overly surprising. I much more enjoy small Punk or Hardcore concerts, where you can have a beer and a nice chat with the band afterwards and generally feel much more involved...</p>

<p>"teemow":http://teemow.com/ and his girlfriend are going to stay in Vienna for a few days, so I guess we'll go out partying tonight which should be good fun! :)</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'll have brunch at "Restaurant Leopold":http://www.restaurant-leopold.at/ with my girlfriend and will go to see "JR Ewing":http://www.thejrewing.com/ and "Coheed and Cambria":http://www.coheedandcambria.com/ in the "Arena Wien":http://www.arena.co.at/ with my former flatmate.</p>
