    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After ignoring or even bashing the game for a long long time, i surprisingly bought a copy of "World of Warcraft":http://www.wow-europe.com/en/ last Thursday, a fact I entirely blame on "Joi Ito":http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5160442894955175707. Of course I'm playing the game on my shiny new "Macbook":http://www.apple.com/macbook/ and I have to say that I really enjoy it so far. Or maybe that's just because being a monster slaughtering Troll shaman is much easier than dealing with certain real life issues I'm currently facing. As it seems decadence kills depression once again... Considering this last argument it's a shame that there won't be a Mac version of "Warhammer Online":http://www.warhammeronline.com/english/home/index.php, because I'm pretty sure by the time it will be released I'll have some new issues which will need some good ol' repressing.</p>

<p>Oh, before you become the n+1th person (where n is fairly large) to ask: Yes, I know the South Park episode.</p>
