    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m really interested to get some opinions on this particular topic: is there a conncection between how people perceive their own knowledge of computers and what kind of hardware they buy?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering because I&rsquo;ve just been reading a discussion about the new Intel based notebooks, especially the new Mac Books which will be released in June. With 13,3" it will be the smallest of Apple&rsquo;s new offerings, and a lot of people have cried loud for a MacBook Pro &ndash; ok, the name really sounds stupid &ndash; with the same form factor. But will they really feel a difference? Or do they just want them because the &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; makes them feel better (no insult intended)? My own hardware almost always has been pretty old, and I have never much felt the need to own something better just because I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;power user&rdquo; (periods of &ldquo;decadence kills depression&rdquo; excluded of course ;) ). And what&rsquo;s a power user anyway?</p>

<p>When my last notebook broke, I ressurected my old desktop machine (an Athlon 650 with 320MB RAM). Although not blazingly fast, I was able to do everything I wanted. My computing needs may be really simple, but given that I was able to read my mails, surf the web and working/coding in several terminal windows while listening to my MP3s or web radio, why should I bother buying new hardware? The same goes for the Mac Mini which will hopefully get delivered next week: why pay a lot more money for a Core Duo, when the Core Solo is already way better than the machine I had before that and which did everything I wanted? With all the money I have already saved by not buying computers I won&rsquo;t really use to their full potential anyway, I can easily buy complete new systems when I don&rsquo;t want to upgrade the current ones anymore&hellip;</p>

<p>How about you guys out there? Do you buy fancy new hardware because it makes you feel &ldquo;1337&rdquo;? Or are you still using your 486 because as a real hacker you know how to squeeze out every percent of performance possible?</p>
