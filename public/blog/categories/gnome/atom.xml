    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While my girlfriend was visiting her sister in Rotterdam, I finally set up her notebook to dual boot Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux. Before you think bad of me: I didn't sneakily do this without her knowing, but instead because she once mentioned that she'd like to try out another OS.</p>

<p>Now you may wonder why I chose Ubuntu over Gentoo, but I'm afraid the answer is rather pragmatic and uninspired: I had a magazine CD of the current release, so I dind't have to download an ISO. Also installation is fast and painless and there are lots of nice HOWTOs. Besides that I've aleady used Ubuntu to convert one of my non-techy friends to Linux and it has worked pretty good. To sum it up: I think Ubuntu is a decent distro, but I maybe wouldn't use it on one of my own boxes.</p>

<p>Back to the original topic: I'm really curious to see how well my girlfriend will get along with her new operating system... So far it seems she'll have a smooth transition. There are free alternatives for all the programs she uses on a regular basis and I found a nice explanation of how to "share Firefox and Thunderbird profiles on a dual boot system":http://www.plaintivemewling.com/?p=20 (the link doesn't contain anything surprising, but it's a nice reference anyway). Additionally I'm really curious to see how she will like "GNOME":http://www.gnome.org/ and if she finds it as user-friendly as I do.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I finally had a little more time to work on Gentoo related things again, so I commited some overdue packages to the tree.</p>

<p>The action started on Tuesday, when I commited the 20+ ebuilds from "ruby-gnome-0.14.1":http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/ (mostly version bumps plus a few new packages like "ruby-gtkmozembed":http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?RubyZilla). Quite a lot of users have been waiting for this, as the previous version we had in the tree (0.12.0) didn't play nicely with GTK+ 2.8/GNOME 2.12. This problems are now sorted, so that quite a few bugs could be closed and marked fixed. :)</p>

<p>And then "George released Nitro 0.25.0":http://www.gmosx.com/article/2 yesterday, which found its way into the tree only hours later. This has mainly to do with the fact that I already had everything in place from the 0.24.0 release, which I then never commited because George said that there soon will be a release focussed on bug fixes and code clean-up. Apparently this has worked out nicely, so go ahaed, emerge "Nitro":http://www.nitrohq.com/ and play around with it, I'm sure you'll like it.</p>

<p>In the evening "we":http://aglug.net had our montly Viennese Gentoo users meetup, which as always was really funny. I came home pretty late and my head still hurts, but it definitely was among the most entertaining evenings in the last few weeks. Thanks guys!</p>

    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2005/09/11/lazy-sunday-afternoon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is the perfect example of a nice and lazy afternoon, and I just love it! After having a great brunch at "HighTea":http://hightea.at/ where we had toasties, antipasti, bagles and lots of other really good stuff, I'm just hanging around in front of my PC reading, doing some Gentoo work and generally having a good time. Live can be so easy... :)</p>

<p>Now let's see if I have anything interesting to tell you:<!--more-->
* "OSNews":http://www.osnews.com/ had a "review of GNOME 2.12":http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=11800 and Eugenia seems to enjoy the new release as much as I do. Although she also points out some drawbacks of the desktop environment as lacking good API docs and a RAD tool, she concludes that "[...] Gnome 2.12 is the best X11 DE there is". You wonder why? Because "all in all, Gnome is today more powerful, better integrated to the underlying system with DBUS and HAL, looks good, behaves as expected and, most of all, it's simple and clean". I couldn't agree more! (via "FootNotes":http://www.gnomedesktop.org)</p>

<br>


<ul>
<li>A fellow Gentoo developer convinced me to start hanging out on IRC regularly, which I now do despite being a little reluctant at first. But after two or three weeks I can see all the positive effects this has had for my dev work, which may also have to do with my further increased feeling of being part of a larger community. Directly (as in chat vs. mail) communicating with people really can do wonders for understanding each other better... If you got something you want to tell me, you'll find me as 'citizen428' (surprising, huh?) on Freenode where I usually can be found in #gentoo-bsd, #gentoo-dev, #gentoo-ruby and #nitro.</li>
</ul>


<br>


<ul>
<li>I've been looking for new Linux games and have found "OpenAnno":http://www.lanadminsystem.de/cgi-bin/Lanas.pl?OPENANNO and "The Mana World":http://themanaworld.org/, which both look promising but are still in early stages of development.</li>
</ul>


<br>


<ul>
<li>Read a "shocking account":http://www.filmstadtinferno.de/offener_kanal.htm (in German) of how the "Livorno":http://www.livornocalcio.it/ "Ultras":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultras and their German visitors got treated by the police in Rome after the game against Lazio. Carabinieri vaffanculo!</li>
</ul>


<br>


<ul>
<li>Want to create your own first person shooter? Have fun with "FPS Creator":http://www.fpscreator.com/! It uses DirectX though, so you're stuck to Windows... :(</li>
</ul>


<br>


<ul>
<li>For all you music lovers out there, make sure to check out the Flash magazine "Music Hurts":http://musichurts.com/! I got the link from the current print issue of "de:bug":http://www.de-bug.de/, a magazine you definitely should check out when you're into electronic music!</li>
</ul>


<p>That's it for today, see you at the next episode of "citizen428's random link dump"!</p>

    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2005/09/06/a-first-look-at-gnome-2-12_rc1/"/>
    <updated>2005-09-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2005/09/06/a-first-look-at-gnome-2-12_rc1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've "already blogged":http://citizen428.net/archives/198-GNOME-goodness.html about this "preview of GNOME 2.12":http://www.gnome.org/~davyd/gnome-2-12/ a while ago and talked about how eager I am to try out this new release. So when Gentoo developer John N. Laliberte "asked":http://www.mail-archive.com/gentoo-dev@lists.gentoo.org/msg04235.html for some people willing to test the ebuilds for GNOME-2.12_rc1, I immediately went ahead and installed them.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Thanks to the <i>package.keywords</i>, <i>package.unmask</i> and testing instructions Nathaniel "provides":http://dev.gentoo.org/~allanonjl/gnome/2.12_rc/, the whole process is really straight forward, although I had to add <i>x11-libs/libsvg-cairo</i> and <i>sys-apps/pmount</i> to aforementioned config files. After this I just removed "Epiphany":http://dev.gentoo.org/~allanonjl/gnome/2.12_rc/ and everything related to "Evolution":http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/features/evolution.html from the meta-ebuild, as I'm really happy with "Firefox":http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ and "Sylpheed-claws":http://claws.sylpheed.org/, especially since I use a version of the latter that is linked against "GTK+-2.8.3":http://www.gtk.org/ and therefore not only looks better, but finally has good support for Unicode thanks to "Pango":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pango. I'm glad that Gentoo's flexible nature gives me the possibility to leave out exactly they 3 or 4 packages I don't need, without loosing the ability to install GNOME via Portage!</p>

<p>Installation went smoothly, but when i first started my new desktop my two panels didn't work. I soon found out that this had to do with GTK+-2.8.3 and that this "bug":http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104820 has been fixed in <i>gtk+-2.8.3-r1.ebuild</i>. And indeed, re-emerging gtk, gnome-desktop and gnome-panel (just to be sure) really fixed this issues, and I now have this shiny new GNOME 2.12 that I <em>really</em> love! :)</p>

<p>The new default theme called "Clearlooks" is really neat, especially in combination with my currently favorite icon theme called "Kreski Lines":http://art.gnome.org/themes/icon/1008. But there's another reason why GNOME 2.12 looks as good as it does: the underlying toolkit GTK+ is now linked against the vector graphics library "Cairo":http://cairographics.org/introduction, which - to quote the preview - allows for "smoother edges, RGBA translucency and better looking, more flexible theming". Additionally this also offers the possibility to accelerate graphics through OpenGL via "Glitz":http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/glitz. I also like the new spatial tree view in Nautilus (maybe I'll start using it now), as well as all the other cool small changes and feature additions. And I'm sure there's some more nice stuff I haven't discovered yet... Unfortunately the much anticipated "Evince":http://www.gnome.org/projects/evince/ doesn't work for me, it only shows some garbled up text when looking at a PDF that works perfectly fine in "GPdf":http://freshmeat.net/projects/gpdf/.</p>

<p>Once again the GNOME team has been very active and put lots of nice stuff into this new release, and I really like the overall direction of the project, viz providing users with a desktop that is easy and intuitive to use and which doesn't get in your way. At the same time it is offering a nice framework for application developers, especially since we have Mono. Thanks to all the people who make this possible!</p>

<p>BTW: a screenshot of my current setup can be seen at the top of the right sidebar, where from now on I wil regularly post pictures of my desktops.</p>

    <updated>2005-08-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2005/08/24/mono-a-developers-notebook</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, today my copy of "Mono: A Developer's Notebook":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596007922/qid=1124917941/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4699908-2098445?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846 finally arrived! I ordered this book because I'm a fan of "Mono":http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page pretty much since I've first heard about it, and examples like this "tutorial on writing a web browser":http://primates.ximian.com/~edasque/projects/Tutorial/glade2.html show that the framework is quite capable. Additionally there are all this cool new GNOME apps like Blam!, Beagle, f-spot, Tomboy etc., that demonstrate the possibilites of Mono.</p>

<p>That's why I ordered this book that has gotten pretty good reviews everywhere and which was modelled after the important FOSS mantra "Show me the code!". Instead of long-winded syntactical explanations, the author uses lots of annotated examples to get his point across. I hope that this weekend I'll have some free time to get started with reading.... :)</p>

<p>A last note: it's incredibly cool that Amazon gives you the possibility to buy books from alternative   dealers via their site! I can go to Amazon, look for the books I'm interested in, read the reviews etc. and then compare if it may be cheaper to buy this book somewhere else. And if it really is, I can still buy the book as if I would have bought it from Amazon. But guess what? Of all the books I've ordered there, only 2 so far were from alternative dealers, because most of the time the extra shipment costs make the book more expensive than the ad itself makes you believe. But for the "Developer's Notebook" it really made sense to buy it from "Caiman":http://caiman.com/, because it was not only cheaper, I also got the book after 7 days (from Florida!) compared to 10 to 13 days Amazon.de states as delivery time for this article.</p>

<p>P.S. I'm tired. My English probably sucks because of that. Live with it.</p>
