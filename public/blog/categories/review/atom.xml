    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4828.en.html">Antiforensik</a><br>How to work against forensics. Nothing revolutionary, but a solid talk.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4587.en.html">bup: Git for backups</a><br>An interesting backup project using git, this is open source and still needs help in case you are looking for something to work on.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4856.en.html">The engineering part of social engineering</a><br>I wasn't entirely convinced by this talk. While there were some interesting points, the speaker was quite full of himself and frankly the talk wasn't so different from other SE talks that I've seen before.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4754.en.html">Smart Hacking For Privacy</a><br>This started off rather bad when  one of the 2 speakers couldn't get over this nervousness, but ended up being a really funny and interesting talk, which was later joined by the CEO of the company whose product got hacked.</li>

<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4767.en.html">Security Log Visualization with a Correlation Engine</a><br>Nothing too special, but still rather interesting, especially since I need this for work at the moment.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4746.en.html">Bitcoin - An Analysis</a><br>This was a great talk about the current state of Bitcoin, highly recommended if you have any interest in the topic.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4663.en.html">Cellular protocol stacks for Internet</a><br>Harald Welte's talks on mobile related stuff are usually great, but I didn't get much out of this one, which felt a bit like acronym bullshit bingo (which is not Harald's fault of course).</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4780.en.html">Print Me If You Dare</a><br>One of my favorite talks of this year's congress, you definitely want to watch this. Update your printer firmware first though ;-)</li>

<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4770.en.html">Don't scan, just ask</a><br>This sounded a lot more interesting than it actually was, especially since the tool that was introduced is not publicly available (as far as I know that is).</li>

<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4775.en.html">Hacker Jeopardy</a><br>Fun as always, but this year's questions seemed a lot easier than the ones I remember from previous years.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick summary of the talks I saw on day 1 (powered by <a href="http://www.flora-power.de/">Flora Power</a>, since I already started this year's congress with a lack of sleep).</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4897.en.html">Marriage From Hell</a><br> Authoritarian governments using surveillance technologies provided by Western companies is not exactly news. Not a bad talk, although it was a bit from the "No shit, Sherlock" department. Not worthy of a keynote in my opinion.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4711.en.html">The Atari 2006 Video Computer System</a><br>Since I love hearing about old hardware and its limitations, this was an awesome talk. The speaker definitely knew what he was talking about and the presentation was very solid.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4799.en.html">Can trains be hacked?</a><br>Another good talk, but understandably there was no information on actually hacking the train system. If you want more info on this topic, listen to <a href="http://cre.fm/cre171">Chaos Radio Express #171</a> from December last year.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4661.en.html">SCADA and PLC Vulnerabilities in Correctional Facilities</a><br>Since I wanted to charge my notebook, I watched this one as a stream. This of course led to web surfing and IRC, so I didn't pay as much attention as this talk would have deserved.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4913.en.html">Almighty DNA?</a><br>Why collecting DNA is also a form of data retention. If you've been to similar talks before you probable knew most of the stories they told, if not the video and <a href="http://cre.fm/cre143">Chaos Radio Express #143</a> should be good resources to catch up.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4713.en.html">What is in a name?</a><br>The history of names and identity regimes from 1500 until today. Pretty interesting, but unfortunately I was in a bit of a post-dinner food coma.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4736.en.html">Defending mobile phones</a><br>This talk was really full and unfortunately the stream didn't work either, so I ended up watching the second half of  <a href="Macro%20dragnets:%20Why%20trawl%20the%20river%20when%20you%20can%20do%20the%20whole%20ocean">Macro dragnets: Why trawl the river when you can do the whole ocean</a> which had some interesting info on avoiding face recognition and other things.<br></li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4817.en.html">String Oriented Programming</a><br>A talk about evading ASLR, DEP and other security measures with <code>printf</code> exploits.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2011/12/21/review-the-art-of-r-programming/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-21T20:06:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2011/12/21/review-the-art-of-r-programming</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer: Once again No Starch Press were kind enough to provide me with a review copy of a book, but this does not influence my reviews.</em></p>

<p>Time for another book review, this time <a href="http://nostarch.com/artofr.htm">The Art of R Programming</a> by Norman Matloff. First things first, this book really lives up to its name! It's a thorough introduction to programming in R, aimed at software developers. This is <strong>not</strong> the book for you if you want to learn about the statistics side of R or how to make prettier plots, there are plenty of books about that anyway.</p>

<p>What I really like is that the author never tries to "sell" R to the reader. This is rather refreshing, because I always get turned off when books start with a sales pitch for something I already clearly showed interest in by purchasing the book. R is a rather specialized language and chances are that you know why you want to solve a given problem in it, and if you don't, this might not yet be the book you should be reading anyway. The first few chapters cover the language's basic data structures like vectors, matrices, arrays, lists and tables, before chapter 7 introduces various flow control structures. What follows is a chapter on doing math and simulations in R, which is not overly long but gives some good examples of what the language is useful for. The next chapter is very interesting, it deals with R's object oriented features and describes the differences between S3 and S4 classes as well as their respective up and down sides. After this the author covers input/output, dealing with strings and R's graphing capabilities. He never gets lost in detail, but provides you with enough info to be able to explore these areas on your own. What really makes the book special though are the last few chapters, where Matloff covers debugging (a topic he also wrote an entire book about), performance tradeoffs, interfacing R with other programming languages (using functions written in C/C++ from R, as well as using R in Python) and various approaches to parallelizing R. While none of this may sound super exciting at first — apart from parallelism maybe — these are important issues in the daily lives of software developers and way too many books only gloss over them.</p>

<p>Now for some criticism: personally I don't find the author's style very engaging, it's rather dry and boring at times. Since it's clear that Matloff is an absolute authority on the topic of R this doesn't way too heavily, but still deserves a mention. Also for my personal taste there are slightly too many forward references in the text, although that's hard to avoid if you want to properly cover a language. I also found it rather odd that at one point the author mentions that explicit return statements aren't exactly idiomatic in R, but that he will keep using them for the benefit of readers unaccustomed to the language. Given that this was a few chapters in, it would have been a perfect spot to switch to the more idiomatic style from then on, but maybe that's just me being nitpicky. I also noticed several little typos and misspellings, something I'm not really used to from No Starch Press.</p>

<p>All in all this is a very solid book, which you definitely should pick up if you want to learn programming in R!</p>
