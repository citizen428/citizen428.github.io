    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been toying around with the idea for a small website lately, but never actually got around to do it. In an attempt to clear out my personal to do list I finally motivated myself to start yesterday, and I have to say the following combination of tools is not only insanely efficient, but also really fun to work with:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, <i>&#8220;a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort&#8221;</i>. I recommend using it in combination with <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">Mongrel</a>, <a href="http://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun">Shotgun</a> and <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">Haml</a>.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, a Ruby cloud hosting platform. Small sites are for free and Heroku&#8217;s git-based workflow just feels so natural. You can also <a href="http://docs.heroku.com/gems">manage your gem dependencies</a> and <a href="http://docs.heroku.com/config-vars">set up environment variables</a>, which made my life a whole lot easier.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a>, <i>&#8220;a scalable, high-performance, open source, schema-free, document-oriented database&#8221;</i>. In this specific case I used <a href="http://www.mongohq.com/home">MongoHQ</a> for the database hosting, since they were nice enough to provide me with a beta account. I stored all the connection information for MongoHQ in environment variables as described above:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/250193.js?file=mongohq.rb"></script>
</ul>


<p>With this combination I was able to go from zero to mostly finished (I still need to write some of the content and make/steal a stylesheet) in very little time, while actually having fun! Thanks everybody for providing the Ruby community which such awesome tools! :&ndash;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;RubyLearning&rdquo;:<a href="http://rubylearning.org">http://rubylearning.org</a> just had a nice one week introductory course on &ldquo;Sinatra&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/,">http://www.sinatrarb.com/,</a> a &ldquo;DSL&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language</a> for easily creating web applications. The next batch will start on May 2nd (and I&rsquo;ll probably be around as a mentor again), you can &ldquo;join here&rdquo;:<a href="http://rubylearning.org/class/course/enrol.php?id=32">http://rubylearning.org/class/course/enrol.php?id=32</a> if you are interested.</p>

<p>Anyway, since it&rsquo;s so easy to write applications with Sinatra, you probably don&rsquo;t want to waste time deploying them. That&rsquo;s where &ldquo;Heroku&rdquo;:<a href="http://heroku.com/">http://heroku.com/</a> comes into play, a Ruby hosting platform which modeled it&rsquo;s workflow around &ldquo;git&rdquo;:<a href="http://git-scm.com/.">http://git-scm.com/.</a> In my &ndash; still somewhat limited &ndash; experience working with Heroku is painless and feels very natural, kudos to the team for providing us with such a nice option for hosting &ldquo;Rack&rdquo;:<a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">http://rack.rubyforge.org/</a> based apps! In fact I liked Heroku so much, that I wrote a patch for <a href="http://quirkey.com/">Aaron Quint</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;sinatra-gen&rdquo;:<a href="http://github.com/quirkey/sinatra-gen/tree/master">http://github.com/quirkey/sinatra-gen/tree/master</a> which will initialize git and create your app on Heroku for you. It&rsquo;s not in the main branch yet, but Aaron said he likes the idea and that he will include it. Up until then you can get my version from &ldquo;here&rdquo;:<a href="http://github.com/citizen428/sinatra-gen/tree/master.">http://github.com/citizen428/sinatra-gen/tree/master.</a></p>

<p><em>Update: Said patch &ndash; in slightly modified form &ndash; is now part of mainline sinatra-gen, so I recommend getting the &ldquo;official&rdquo; version, not mine.</em></p>

<p>Oh yeah, once you are done creating all this shiny new webapps in Sinatra, don&rsquo;t forget to take some snapshots of them with &ldquo;snapurl&rdquo;:<a href="http://github.com/jurisgalang/snapurl/tree/master,">http://github.com/jurisgalang/snapurl/tree/master,</a> another nifty little app I recently wrote a small patch for.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a lot of people, Ruby became almost equivalent to &ldquo;Rails&rdquo;:<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/,">http://rubyonrails.org/,</a> but this doesn&rsquo;t mean that Rubyists can&rsquo;t choose from a wider selection of web frameworks. One of them is the microframework &ldquo;Sinatra&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/,">http://www.sinatrarb.com/,</a> for which &ldquo;RubyLearning&rdquo;:<a href="http://rubylearning.org">http://rubylearning.org</a> will start a &ldquo;course&rdquo;:<a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/02/25/introduction-to-sinatra-a-new-course/">http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/02/25/introduction-to-sinatra-a-new-course/</a> on March 21st. Registration is open now, the price is a reasonable US$3 for the first 15 people to sign up, US$4 for the next 25 and finally US$5 for everyone after that. Yours truly will also be a mentor for this course and would be happy to see some of you there!</p>
