    <updated>2006-08-12T00:00:00+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.citizen428.net/blog/2006/08/12/delusions-of-grandeur</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As my PR manager told me, large numbers of fans have already complained about the recent lack of updates. Since I&rsquo;m only my reader&rsquo;s humble servant, I of course have to comply with this wishes, so here are the long awaited news about yours truly:</p>

<p><em>Gentoo:</em>
After being a &ldquo;Gentoo&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.gentoo.org">http://www.gentoo.org</a> developer for 2 years, I finally decided to leave the project. Since I haven&rsquo;t really been active for the past 4 month anyway for several reasons (e.g. work), this was long overdue anyway. I&rsquo;ve met a lot of nice and interesting people in the Gentoo community and working with you guys has really been a pleasure! Thanks for that, I really appreciate what I have learned from all of you during that time!</p>

<p><em>Mac:</em>
Today I&rsquo;ve joined the team of &ldquo;Open.Source.Mac&rdquo;:<a href="http://opensourcemac.de/">http://opensourcemac.de/</a> and have already published &ldquo;my first little article&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.opensourcemac.de/2006/08/12/machtgeil/">http://www.opensourcemac.de/2006/08/12/machtgeil/</a> on the site. Enjoy!</p>

<p><em>Personal:</em>
On the 2nd of August I celebrated my 27th birthday at &ldquo;Xeno&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.xeno.co.at/.">http://www.xeno.co.at/.</a> A lot of &ldquo;friends&rdquo;:<a href="http://red667.org/">http://red667.org/</a> showed up, whereas &ldquo;certain people&rdquo;:<a href="http://berq.net/">http://berq.net/</a> decided to get drunk somewhere else and then blamed innocent squirrels for their not showing up. It was a cool evening which I really enjoyed, but working on the next day didn&rsquo;t exactly qualify as a good cure against the headaches&hellip;</p>

<p><em>Capitalism:</em>
I have to admit that I love portable consoles, especially when they are as sexy as the black Nintendo DS Lite I bought three weeks ago. So far I own &ldquo;Advance Wars: Dual Strike&rdquo;:<a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/643/643656p1.html,">http://ds.ign.com/articles/643/643656p1.html,</a> &ldquo;Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day&rdquo;:<a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/702/702057p1.html,">http://ds.ign.com/articles/702/702057p1.html,</a> &ldquo;Feel The Magic XY/XX&rdquo;:<a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/567/567496p1.html">http://ds.ign.com/articles/567/567496p1.html</a> and &ldquo;Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow&rdquo;:<a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/655/655830p1.html.">http://ds.ign.com/articles/655/655830p1.html.</a> All of them are really great and I can hardly wait until my copy of &ldquo;Mario Kart DS&rdquo;:<a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/666/666125p1.html">http://ds.ign.com/articles/666/666125p1.html</a> finally arrives.</p>

<p>I also got myself a nice &ldquo;M9 DX enclosure&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.macpower.com.tw/products/hdd3/m9/m9dx">http://www.macpower.com.tw/products/hdd3/m9/m9dx</a> with a 250GB Samsung HD as a backup disk for the Mac Mini. Overall it&rsquo;s pretty neat, although it could match the color of the Mini a little better.</p>

<p><em>Misc</em>
Found an &ldquo;article&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.explosm.net/articles/6135/4/">http://www.explosm.net/articles/6135/4/</a> about &ldquo;Habbo Hotel&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.habbohotel.co.uk/">http://www.habbohotel.co.uk/</a> on the &ldquo;Pardus&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.pardus.at">http://www.pardus.at</a> forums and just had &ldquo;to try it out&rdquo;:<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/citizen428/sets/72157594226374139/.">http://flickr.com/photos/citizen428/sets/72157594226374139/.</a> Like the author of the article I most likely won&rsquo;t visit the site again, but I had a lot of fun during the hour I spent there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;teemow&rdquo;:<a href="http://teemow.com">http://teemow.com</a> recently blogged about &ldquo;BumpTop&rdquo;:<a href="http://honeybrown.ca/Pubs/BumpTop.html,">http://honeybrown.ca/Pubs/BumpTop.html,</a> a new take at the desktop metaphor we all grew used to. The video is quite impressive and I&rsquo;d really like to try out such an interface myself, as I&rsquo;m interested in how well it works for everyday usage.</p>
