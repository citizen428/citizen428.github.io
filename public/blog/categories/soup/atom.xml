    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Although I do love "my Soup":http://soup.citizen428.net, "Twitter":http://twitter.com/citizen428 and all those other microblogs, tumblelogs and whatgotyou, I recently feel the urge to sometimes write proper long blog posts rising again. Therefore I once again resurrected this blog (I slowly start feeling like the "George Romero":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Romero of blogging), gave it a proper facelift and am now ready to roll again.</p>

<p>On a related note, I'd like to inform you that my 2 Feedburner feeds will get deactivated in 30 days. To be honest, I can't even remember why I got them in the first place, but I'm pretty sure I had a really good reason back then ("Are you pondering what I'm pondering?"). Anyway, there's still plenty of subscription options here and on Soup, so you really don't have to stop stalking me if you don't fell like it.</p>
