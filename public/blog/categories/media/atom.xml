<li>"How Goldman Sachs Created the Food Crisis":http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/27/how_goldman_sachs_created_the_food_crisis<br>I lack the data and insight to fully judge the truth of this article, but I'm fairly certain that a non-trivial percentage of the world-wide rise in food prices was due to speculation. Isn't it great how cynical humans can be?</li>
<li>"World's largest model airport the Knuffingen goes on show":http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/man-builds-worlds-largest-model-airport-the-knuffingen/story-e6frfq80-1226050348557<br>After 7 years and millions of Euros the world's largest model airport goes on show.

<li>"How to Identify and Avoid Spreading Misinformation, Myths, and Urban Legends on the Internet":http://lifehacker.com/?_escaped_fragment_=5798308/how-to-identify-and-avoid-spreading-misinformation-myths-and-urban-legends-on-the-internet<br>I know I've posted links like this one before, but some things really do need to be repeated.</li>
<li>"Das Herz des Attentäters":http://www.freitag.de/wissen/1118-das-herz-des-attentaeters<br>It's probably not as simple as this, but definitely something to think about (in German).</li>
<li>"Google Go boldly goes where no code has gone before":http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/05/google_go/<br>While I don't necessarily agree with the title, it's still a nice article on a language we here surprising little about.</li>
<li>"25 Abandoned Yugoslavia Monuments that look like they're from the Future":http://www.cracktwo.com/2011/04/25-abandoned-soviet-monuments-that-look.html<br>I always was attracted to socialist architecture and the monuments in this article are no exception.</li>
<li>"Small areas of the brain go to sleep when we're up too late":http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/04/if-you-only-feel-half-awake-you-probably-are.ars<br>Sleep is a strange beast I've been struggling with to varying degrees for almost as long as I can remember, which is one reason why I like reading about it.</li>
