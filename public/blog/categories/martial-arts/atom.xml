    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I started my new job this January, I more or less stopped doing any sports, which had the usual consequences of fitness&mdash;&nbsp;&amp;&amp; weight++. I&rsquo;ve wanted to change this for quite a while now and since my local &ldquo;Taekwondo school&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.taekwondo-twin-center.at/home.php?ttc_schule_id=8">http://www.taekwondo-twin-center.at/home.php?ttc_schule_id=8</a> &ndash; which by the way is conviniently located half-way between my apartment and the office &ndash; currently has a special offer (two private introductory lessons plus the &ldquo;dobok&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobok">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobok</a> for 25 Euro) I decided to give it a go. The first intro lesson today was pretty cool and the second will be this Wednesday. After this I&rsquo;ll get my white belt and will formally start training in the beginner&rsquo;s class.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b>
Had my second private lesson on Wednesday and really liked it too, so I signed up for the school and will try to train 2-3 times a week from now on. Since there are 13(!) training sessions per week I can choose from, I should be able to squeeze them in even in rather busy weeks.</p>
