    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 2 weeks ago I finally started looking into <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, a language that's been on my radar for a while but that I never really got around to play with so far. Then I realized that the <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nse.html">Nmap Scripting Engine</a> uses Lua scripts, so I had an excuse to hack on this stuff for work. Here's my first small <code>nmap</code> script, which will extract the contents of the generator meta tag if there is one. It's nothing funky, but it shows how easy it is to write custom scripts for <code>nmap</code> thanks to the provided libraries like <code>http</code> and <code>shortport</code>.</p>
