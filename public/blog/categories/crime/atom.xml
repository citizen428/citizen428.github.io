    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week "Information Overload" is back in full swing, and there really were lots of interesting things I stumbled upon:</p>

<ul>
<li>"The Biggest Company You've Never Heard Of":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNLMtgI7hU<br>Interesting two and a half minute video about "Serco":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serco, a company I indeed never had heard of before.</li>
<li>"Goran Lindberg and Sweden's dark side":http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/01/goran-lindberg-sweden-crime-palme<br>Are "Stieg Larsson's":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stieg_Larsson novels closer to the truth than expectd?</li>
<li>"Third Kim lucky?":http://www.economist.com/node/16994770?story_id=16994770<br>This article suggests that "Kim Jong-un":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un will become "Kim Jong-il's":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_jong_il successor. I'd have expected a kind of military/party government after the latter's retirement/death, let's see what actually happens.</li>
<li>"Genetic Scars of the Holocaust: Children Suffer Too":http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2016824,00.html<br>"Epigenetics":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics in the context of Holocaust victims and their children. </li>
<li>"The Most Powerful Colors in the World":http://www.colourlovers.com/business/blog/2010/09/15/the-most-powerful-colors-in-the-world<br>With so many colors to choose from, companies don't seem to be overly creative when deciding on their logos.</li>
<li>"Todesopfer rechter Gewalt":http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/todesopfer-rechter-gewalt<br>Interactive map of of people who died due to right-wing violence in Germany. Also see "137 Todesopfer rechter Gewalt":http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/rechtsextremismus/137-todesopfer-rechter-gewalt/1934424.html for more information on the victims (both in German).</li>
<li>"Itunes Remove duplicated songs":http://sergioveiga.com/index.php/2010/09/16/itunes-remove-duplicated-songs/<br>It's always nice to see something based on my blog posts, especially in this case where it was the first time ever I wrote something about Erlang.</li>
<li>"The Myth of the Boy Wizard":http://blog.jgc.org/2010/09/myth-of-boy-wizard.html<br>After the recently discovered flaw in "Haystack":http://www.haystacknetwork.com/, "Austin Heap":http://blog.austinheap.com/ got a lot of flak. This article is an interesting take on the media's role and responsibility in all of this.</li>
<li>"Zeros to heroes: 10 unlikely ideas that changed the world":http://www.newscientist.com/special/zeros-to-heroes-10-unlikely-ideas-that-changed-the-world<br>A good reminder to keep on hacking despite the odds.</li>
<li>"Clojure is Fast":http://learnclojure.blogspot.com/2010/09/clojure-is-fast.html<br>If you ever where curious just how fast you can get your Clojure code to run, this will provide some valuable insight.</li>
<li>"Lawsuit challenges Obama's power to kill citizens without due process":http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/08/30/assassinations/index.html<br>You know a country is fucked once it needs a lawsuit like this.</li>
</ul>
