    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4828.en.html">Antiforensik</a><br>How to work against forensics. Nothing revolutionary, but a solid talk.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4587.en.html">bup: Git for backups</a><br>An interesting backup project using git, this is open source and still needs help in case you are looking for something to work on.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4856.en.html">The engineering part of social engineering</a><br>I wasn't entirely convinced by this talk. While there were some interesting points, the speaker was quite full of himself and frankly the talk wasn't so different from other SE talks that I've seen before.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4754.en.html">Smart Hacking For Privacy</a><br>This started off rather bad when  one of the 2 speakers couldn't get over this nervousness, but ended up being a really funny and interesting talk, which was later joined by the CEO of the company whose product got hacked.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4767.en.html">Security Log Visualization with a Correlation Engine</a><br>Nothing too special, but still rather interesting, especially since I need this for work at the moment.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4746.en.html">Bitcoin - An Analysis</a><br>This was a great talk about the current state of Bitcoin, highly recommended if you have any interest in the topic.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4663.en.html">Cellular protocol stacks for Internet</a><br>Harald Welte's talks on mobile related stuff are usually great, but I didn't get much out of this one, which felt a bit like acronym bullshit bingo (which is not Harald's fault of course).</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4780.en.html">Print Me If You Dare</a><br>One of my favorite talks of this year's congress, you definitely want to watch this. Update your printer firmware first though ;-)</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4814.en.html">Behind the scenes of a C64 demo</a><br>The C64 is the reason I became a software developer, so obviously I really enjoyed this talk. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH6_1dEVWds">The demo</a> is really good too!</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4866.en.html">Fnord-Jahresr√ºckblick</a><br>Fun as always.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4770.en.html">Don't scan, just ask</a><br>This sounded a lot more interesting than it actually was, especially since the tool that was introduced is not publicly available (as far as I know that is).</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4680.en.html">Effective Denial of Service attacks against web application platforms</a><br>Great talk, solid presentation, this is the type of talk you want to download the video for.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4763.en.html">The Science of Insecurity</a><br>Another great presentation, another definite recommendation.</li>

<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4756.en.html">Quantified-Self and OpenBCI Neurofeedback Mind-Hacking</a><br>One big WTF and I definitely would have left, but unfortunately one of the 2 speakers had to borrow my ThinkPad power supply so I was stuck in this talk until the bitter end.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4775.en.html">Hacker Jeopardy</a><br>Fun as always, but this year's questions seemed a lot easier than the ones I remember from previous years.</li>

    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2011/12/27/28c3-day-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick summary of the talks I saw on day 1 (powered by <a href="http://www.flora-power.de/">Flora Power</a>, since I already started this year's congress with a lack of sleep).</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4897.en.html">Marriage From Hell</a><br> Authoritarian governments using surveillance technologies provided by Western companies is not exactly news. Not a bad talk, although it was a bit from the "No shit, Sherlock" department. Not worthy of a keynote in my opinion.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4711.en.html">The Atari 2006 Video Computer System</a><br>Since I love hearing about old hardware and its limitations, this was an awesome talk. The speaker definitely knew what he was talking about and the presentation was very solid.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4799.en.html">Can trains be hacked?</a><br>Another good talk, but understandably there was no information on actually hacking the train system. If you want more info on this topic, listen to <a href="http://cre.fm/cre171">Chaos Radio Express #171</a> from December last year.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4661.en.html">SCADA and PLC Vulnerabilities in Correctional Facilities</a><br>Since I wanted to charge my notebook, I watched this one as a stream. This of course led to web surfing and IRC, so I didn't pay as much attention as this talk would have deserved.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4913.en.html">Almighty DNA?</a><br>Why collecting DNA is also a form of data retention. If you've been to similar talks before you probable knew most of the stories they told, if not the video and <a href="http://cre.fm/cre143">Chaos Radio Express #143</a> should be good resources to catch up.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4713.en.html">What is in a name?</a><br>The history of names and identity regimes from 1500 until today. Pretty interesting, but unfortunately I was in a bit of a post-dinner food coma.</li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4736.en.html">Defending mobile phones</a><br>This talk was really full and unfortunately the stream didn't work either, so I ended up watching the second half of  <a href="Macro%20dragnets:%20Why%20trawl%20the%20river%20when%20you%20can%20do%20the%20whole%20ocean">Macro dragnets: Why trawl the river when you can do the whole ocean</a> which had some interesting info on avoiding face recognition and other things.<br></li>
<li><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4817.en.html">String Oriented Programming</a><br>A talk about evading ASLR, DEP and other security measures with <code>printf</code> exploits.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2011-08-15T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2011/08/15/chaos-communication-camp-2011</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After "What the Hack":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Hack in 2005 and the "Chaos Communication Camp 2007":http://events.ccc.de/camp/2007/Intro/ this was my third hacker camp and once again it was an inspiring, funny, chaotic and productive week of talks, hacking, partying, networking and more.</p>

<p>Monday was mostly spent driving to the camp, which all in all went rather smoothly. All hail to Tesco where we picked up a lot of equipment, including the super awesome tent we slept in. Tuesday was a good opportunity to get a first impression of the camp, see who's there, starting to socialize and having a party.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the talks started and I saw three of them. "Strong encryption of credit card information":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4421.en.html was really quite interesting and once again I was shocked by how insecure some very important aspects of our lives are. "Strahlung im Weltall":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4505.en.html dealt with space radiation and was part of the "Hackers in Space":http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4551.en.html track of the conference. When you think web development is difficult, how about dealing with radiation that might randomly flip a bit? Last but not least "GPRS Intercept":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4504.en.html was another rather shocking talk, showing that GPRS security is as bad as GSM's.</p>

<p>Thursday I started with "Die psychologischen Grundlagen des Social Engineerings":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4478.en.html, which was a really good and interesting talk by Stefan Schumacher, who's a really nice guy who spent quite a bit of time at our "village":http://leiwandville.soup.io/. "Steal Everything, Kill Everyone, Cause Total Financial Ruin!":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4488.en.html was another social engineering related talk and very entertaining. I got to talk to Jayson later that night and he really is as adorable as he says ;-) One of the talks I was most looking forward to was "Hacking DNA":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4472.en.html and I wasn't disappointed. As an added bonus Marc took some time on Saturday to come over to our village and help us with some really useful information on how to get a biohacking group going at a hackerspace.</p>

<p>Friday I spent mostly socializing, but I also went to see 2 talks. "She-Hackers: Millennials and Gender in European F/LOSS Subculture":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4487.en.html unfortunately was the worst lecture I saw at this camp, which is a real shame considering that the topic at hand was very interesting. In the evening I watched "Certified programming with dependent types":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4426.en.html, which was a fairly interesting introduction to the "Coq Proof Assistant":http://coq.inria.fr/. As often with Andreas's talks the title and abstract suggested slightly more, but it still was a solid and interesting presentation.</p>

<p>Saturday started rather late for me due to Friday night's party, but I still woke up in time for "Moonbounce Radio Communication":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4597.en.html, held by members of Metalab's amateur radio crew. Later that day the Metalab was on stage again, this time in the form of "Rethinking online news":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4491.en.html, which was an awesome presentation that led to a nice little meetup of interested parties the next afternoon. Stay tuned on this front, there might be interesting things happening in the not too distant future! The most amazing part of the day for me though was taking a 20 minute flight in an "Antonov An-2":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-2 from 1968, which was really cool and worth every cent of the 45 Euro it cost.</p>

<p>On Sunday I watched "Data Mining Your City":https://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/Fahrplan/events/4445.en.html, which was not as interesting as I'd hoped for. It sadly also was the day where we had to say goodbye to the camp :-(</p>

<p>Random thoughts: It's super inspiring to spend an entire week around several thousand intelligent and creative people and like always after such an event I feel invigorated and full of ideas. I also finally should learn not to count on getting any work on one of my projects done at the camp, it never really works. Sometimes I wonder why I even bother bringing my laptop, an iPad or Netbook would probably be sufficient. But then why would I sit in front of my computer working on the same stuff I'm working on for the rest of the year when I'm surrounded by loads of interesting things and people I haven't met yet?</p>

<p>I &lt;3 you, Chaos Communication Camp!</p>
