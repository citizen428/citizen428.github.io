    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While my girlfriend was visiting her sister in Rotterdam, I finally set up her notebook to dual boot Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux. Before you think bad of me: I didn&rsquo;t sneakily do this without her knowing, but instead because she once mentioned that she&rsquo;d like to try out another OS.</p>

<p>Now you may wonder why I chose Ubuntu over Gentoo, but I&rsquo;m afraid the answer is rather pragmatic and uninspired: I had a magazine CD of the current release, so I dind&rsquo;t have to download an ISO. Also installation is fast and painless and there are lots of nice HOWTOs. Besides that I&rsquo;ve aleady used Ubuntu to convert one of my non-techy friends to Linux and it has worked pretty good. To sum it up: I think Ubuntu is a decent distro, but I maybe wouldn&rsquo;t use it on one of my own boxes.</p>

<p>Back to the original topic: I&rsquo;m really curious to see how well my girlfriend will get along with her new operating system&hellip; So far it seems she&rsquo;ll have a smooth transition. There are free alternatives for all the programs she uses on a regular basis and I found a nice explanation of how to &ldquo;share Firefox and Thunderbird profiles on a dual boot system&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.plaintivemewling.com/?p=20">http://www.plaintivemewling.com/?p=20</a> (the link doesn&rsquo;t contain anything surprising, but it&rsquo;s a nice reference anyway). Additionally I&rsquo;m really curious to see how she will like &ldquo;GNOME&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</a> and if she finds it as user-friendly as I do.</p>
