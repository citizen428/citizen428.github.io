    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Steve Rogers aka "Captain America has died":http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/books/03/07/captain.america/index.html in Marvel's recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(comics)">Civil War</a> story line.</p>

<p>Although he never was among my favorite comic heroes, you just don't let a super hero die like this. And if you do, don't later resurrect him. I still can remember how I was traumatized when Superman died in the arms of Lois and how affected I was when all the other super heroes attended his funeral to show their respect, only to get disappointed by "Reign of the Supermen" and the later resurrection.</p>

<p>Farewall Captain America, and don't let them turn you into a zombie!</p>
