    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><i>You have nil shillings. You are a simple cleric, you have 10 more shillings to earn before you have proven your xpath/regexen charming skills on par with the druids. A real druid will check your work and pay you soon enough.</i> - "http://hoodwink.d/":http://hoodwink.d/</p>

<p>But I've been working hard and tried to prove these druids that my xpath and regex skills are up to their standards. I have hopefully earned my first shilling and I've earned it with my very own site! :) So you hoodwinkers out there, feel free to leave your winks instead of regular comments from now on!</p>

<p>And don't be afraid when you have nfc what I'm talking about, "this link":http://hoodwinkd.hobix.com/ explains it all, so open your eyes and feel around...</p>
