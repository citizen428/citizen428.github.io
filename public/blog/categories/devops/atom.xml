<li>"The OS Doesn't Matter...":http://www.mondaynote.com/2010/10/03/the-os-doesn%E2%80%99t-matter/<br>Interesting take on why OS wars don't really matter anymore, since basically everything except for Windows has moved in a Unix direction or will do so in the near future. Quote: "This is today's OS. User experience. Development tools."</li>
<li>"Why newspapers make you stupid":http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/2660/why-newspapers-make-you-stupid/<br>On media bias and why you will need more background information and context than newspapers generally provide.</li>
<li>"TryClojure - A Call To Action":http://blog.acidrayne.net/?p=25<br><a href="http://tryclj.licenser.net/">TryClojure</a>'s author is asking for help in keeping the project alive and kicking. Check out the related "Google Group":http://groups.google.com/group/tryclojure if you may be interested in helping out.</li>
<li>"The Fed's $600 Billion Statement, Translated Into Plain English":http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131043062&ps=cprs<br>The "Fed":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System's latest "statement":http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131043062&ps=cprs in plain English. Created with this "awesome tool by Slate":http://labs.slate.com/articles/plain-english/, there should be more articles like this.</li>
<li>"Man in disguise boards international flight":http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/11/04/canada.disguised.passenger/index.html<br>This week's hilarious contribution to the aviation security circus: an Asian male boards an Air Canada flight in Hong Kong disguised as an elderly Caucasian and asks for refugee protection upon arriving in Vancouver.</li>
<li>"What Is This Devops Thing, Anyway?":http://www.jedi.be/blog/2010/02/12/what-is-this-devops-thing-anyway/<br>Now that the term "devops" is slowly becoming a bit more popular, it's about time to find out what the hype is all about.</li>
<li>"The New War Between Science and Religion":http://chronicle.com/article/The-New-War-Between-Science/65400/<br>Maybe even more dangerous in the long run than followers of "intelligent design", the "accommodationists" are trying to fend off science by declaring certain aspects as off-limits to scientific scrutiny.</li>
<li>"Chatbot Wears Down Proponents of Anti-Science Nonsense":https://www.technologyreview.com/blog/mimssbits/25964/<br>While I can partly understand the frustration that led to writing said bot, I don't think that Twitter spamming people who obviously don't care about rationale arguments is doing but worsen the divide between the religiously and the scientific minded.</li>
<li>"Fractals without a Computer!":http://scientopia.org/blogs/goodmath/2010/11/02/fractals-without-a-computer/<br>This is clever and beautiful at the same time!</li>
<li>"The graffiti knitting epidemic":http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/oct/10/graffiti-knitting<br>This makes me want to learn handycraft, anyone in? ;-)</li>
