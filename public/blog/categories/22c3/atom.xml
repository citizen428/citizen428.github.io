    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;22C3&rdquo;:<a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/">http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/</a> is over since last Friday, but I needed some time to let everything sink in. Besides that I just came home from Germany this morning&hellip; Here&rsquo;s a list of all the talks I saw:</p>

<p><em>Day 1:</em>
Private Investigations
Understanding buffer overflow exploitations
Hacking CCTV
Hacking Data Retention
Bad TRIPs
We lost the war
VoIP Phreaking</p>

<p><em>Day 2:</em>
AJAX Based Web Applications
Anonymous Data Broadcasting by Misuse of Satellite ISPs
Digital Identity and the Ghost in the Machine
Literarisches Code-Quartett</p>

<p><em>Day 3:</em>
COMPLETE Hard Disk Encryption with FreeBSD
How to construct Utopia
The truth about Nanotechnology
Fnord JahresrÃ¼ckblick
Hacker Jeoparday</p>

<p><em>Day 4:</em>
A discussion about modern disk encryption systems</p>

<p><em>People:</em>
&ldquo;berq&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.berq.net/blog/,">http://www.berq.net/blog/,</a> lippi and Manuel were really great company and we had a damn good time together! Thanks guys! :) &ldquo;teemow&rdquo;:<a href="http://teemow.de/">http://teemow.de/</a> also was at the congress, and once again we had some interesting conversations. I&rsquo;ve also met some fellow Gentoo devs, but unfortunately we didn&rsquo;t talk that much. Maybe next year we once again should try to organize a more formal get-together. I&rsquo;ve also met some nice people to play Go with, and although I still suck at this game, I really enjoyed playing it.</p>

<p><em>Misc:</em>
Get rich, because using busses for long-distance travel sucks, at least if you want to sleep. Luckily our hostel (&ldquo;CityStay Berlin Mitte&rdquo;:<a href="http://citystay.de/">http://citystay.de/</a>) did great in that regard, and I only can recommend this place to anyone looking for a clean and cheap accomodation in Berlin.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion:</em>
22C3 definitely was good fun. I&rsquo;ve seen interesting talks, met a lot of nice people and generally had a good time. However, I found the overall quality of the lectures not that impressive and I tried to express this sentiments via the feedback forms&hellip;</p>
