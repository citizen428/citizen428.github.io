<p>Conclusion:
As usual the C3 was a blast: interesting lectures, meeting nice people, and generally having a good time with friends is what makes this event a highlight for me. This year's congress seemed a little less organized and more chaotic than 22C3, but in a way that was quite refreshing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lectures seen on day 2:</p>

<p>"<em>MMORPGs</em>":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1738.en.html
Although I'm not into WoW myself, I was looking forward to see "Joi":http://joi.ito.com/ talk again at the C3. As expected his lecture was quite entertaining and since it wasn't about a "heavy" topic it was a perfect starter for what would become a pretty long day.</p>

<p>"<em>Tor and China</em>":https://events.congress.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1444.en.html
As you might know I'm a big supporter of "Tor":http://tor.eff.org and have studied Chinese for several years, so this was a lecture I was obviously really interested in. The talk was pretty nice, although it didn't offer too much for people already familiar with Tor. Besides that I was a little disappointed that it  actually had so little to do with China, that one could easily have used $genericEvilCountry as an adequate substitute.</p>

<p>"<em>Hackerspaces</em>":https://events.congress.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1500.en.html
"Metalab":http://metalab.at/, "C-Base":http://c-base.org/ and "Netzladen":http://netzladen.org introduced their projects and the challenges involved in creating a Hackerspace in a light-hearted way which was just perfect for me since I was quite tired at that time.</p>

<p>"<em>Stealth malware - can good guys win?</em>":https://events.congress.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1381.en.html
"Joanna Rutkowska":http://invisiblethings.org/ is gorgeous and clever, so she can basically talk about whatever she wants and I will want to marry her afterwards.</p>

<p><a href="https://events.congress.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1651.en.html"><I>Ãœberwachen und Strafen in Entenhausen</I></a>
Ok, but not as funny as her talk 2 years ago.</p>

<p>"<em>You can't make this stuff up</em>":https://events.congress.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1428.en.html
You can't blame Fefe and Ilja for trying, but IMHO this was only a weak substitute for the "Literatisches Code-Quartett".</p>

<p>But the real highlight of the day started at around midnight, when "Monochrom":http://www.monochrom.at started to perform what they call "proto-melodischen interventionismus". It's pretty hard to describe how funny this spontaneous concert which moved through the whole building really was if you haven't been there, so you just have to believe me that this was great stuff!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lectures seen on day 1:</p>

<p>"<em>Who can you trust?</em>":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1256.de.html
Business as usual: introduction by Tim Pritlove, followed by the keynote. This year's speaker was "EFF's":http://www.eff.org/~barlow/ "John Perry Barlow":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow, who talked about ethics and responsibility in the hacker community. Quite nice, although I wasn't all too fond of the way he encouraged people to police their fellow hackers. But for me the most interesting thing possibly was the confirmation of a Chaos Communication Camp in August 2007!</p>

<p>"<em>Design and Implementation of an object-oriented, secure TCP/IP Stack</em>":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1656.de.html
Quite interesting and despite Andreas Bogk's involvement it didn't include too much "Dylan":http://www.opendylan.org/ advocacy.</p>

<p>"<em>The Grim Meathook Future</em>":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1461.en.html
Despite not really having a concept, this lecture wasn't all bad. The speaker was a quite funny and opinionated guy, as were the people who joined the discussion in the end. Nothing great, but quite entertaining.</p>

<p>"<em>Dylan Introduction</em>":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1761.en.html
No concept, terrible English, and altogether not really informative - at least if this wasn't your first contact with Dylan.</p>

<p>"<em>Drones</em>":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1402.en.html
My personal highlight for the day: interesting topic, good and funny presentation, motivating people to go out and have fun. That's how talks at the CCC should be.</p>

<p>"<em>Know Your Citizens</em>":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1537.de.html
"<em>Hacking the Electoral Law</em>":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1692.en.html
"<em>We don't trust voting computers</em>":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1423.en.html
"<em>Revenge of the Female Nerds</em>":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1555.en.html
Since I've been to this talks but haven't payed close attention (IRC, surfing, working on a MySQL problem with berq etc.), I can't really say much about them. I picked up the occasional interesting fact, but other than that I don't think I really missed much.</p>

    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2006/12/26/23c3-preface</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a mostly sleepless bus journey and "some" waiting, we've finally made it to the already quite busy "Hackcenter":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Hackcenter, where we met a few people we know from previous years. About half an hour ago the queue at the ticket counter was way too long, so we're trying our luck a little later. Since we're getting up quite early tomorrow (around 9am) to see the "keynote":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1256.en.html, I'll try to catch a few more hours of sleep tonight.</p>

    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2006/12/25/23c3-here-we-come</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a little less than four hours, "berq":http:berq.net, "lippi":http://twoday.tuwien.ac.at/perm, "red667":http://red667.org, and me will leave for Berlin where we're going to attend the "23C3":http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Home. Since the "Ã–BB":http://oebb.at still sucks, we're once again going by bus, arriving tomorrow at around 6:30am. Judging from last year the time between our arrival until we can check into our "hostel":http://www.hostels.com/en/availability.php/HostelNumber.10594 at around noon will be spent drinking beer, which definitely isn't a recommended breakfast option. Kids, don't try this at home!</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure we'll once again have loads of fun, and unlike the last years I plan on regularly blogging and posting pics from the event, so stay tuned! Anyone interested in meeting up at the 23C3 either post a comment here or send a mail to my GMail account.</p>
