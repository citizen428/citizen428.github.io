    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very good read! In each chapter the author introduces one bug he found in a popular software package, always following the same structure: discovery, exploitation, remediation, lessons learned from the bug and a timeline of the bug&rsquo;s lifetime (disclosure, fix, etc).</p>

<p>The writing is engaging and to the point, but still contains a lot of technical detail. Be warned though, if reading C and disassembly is not your type of thing, you probably won&rsquo;t enjoy this too much. The author tries hard to make everything as easy to understand as possible, but there&rsquo;s only so much you can do with limited space.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s anything to criticize about this book, it&rsquo;s that the chapters are fairly repetitive, so I never really felt like reading more than one in a single sitting. But then it&rsquo;s also not the type of book that needs to be read cover to cover as fast as possible.</p>
