    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I was one of the technical editors of this book, so I may be biased.</p>

<p>While I haven't received <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/ruby-and-mongodb-web-development-beginners-guide/book">the book</a> in its final form yet, I've read all of it, and I can say that the author does a good job at introducing inexperienced programmers to web development with Ruby and MongoDB.</p>

<p>This is a hands-on book and you'll get most out of it by following all the exercises and doing them on your own. From getting all the necessary components and installing them, to developing apps with Sinatra and Rails, a lot of ground is covered.</p>

<p>While the author does tackle some more advanced topics, they are clearly not the focus of this book (it's subtitled "Beginner's Guide" for a reason) which will leave more experienced developers wanting for more. However, the presented material is well written, chapters build on each other and if you are new to web development with Ruby/RoR and/or MongoDB, this is a good title to get you up to speed in just 300 pages.</p>

<p>If you are a more experienced Ruby developer or are already very familiar with MongoDB, this is probably not the book for you, even though you'll probably still get something out of it.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Review: The Tangled Web]]></title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer 1: The good folks of No Starch Press were kind enough to provide me with a review copy of this book, but this did not influence the following text.</em></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer 2: Links to books are Amazon affiliate links.</em></p>

<p>I've been interested in IT security for a long time, but obviously even more so since I started working professionally in this area. Since web applications have become ubiquitous in recent years, they constitute a big part of our penetration testing work. This is a very broad topic, so <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593273886/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=citizen4blog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593273886">The Tangled Web: A Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=citizen4blog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1593273886" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Michal Zalewski is an ambitious project.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was that the book is comparatively thin. At around 300 pages it's only about one third of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026470/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=citizen4blog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118026470">The Web Application Hacker's Handbook: Finding and Exploiting Security Flaws</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=citizen4blog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1118026470" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Don't let that fool you though, this book is not a lightweight by any means. It's logically structured in three parts, the first of which explores the various components that constitute the web as we know it today (URLs, HTTP, HTML, CSS etc.) and their security implications. This is followed by a look at the security features — and their shortcomings — of current browsers. After this part 3 deals with current developments and the future of browser and web application security. This is rounded off by a list of common security problems including references to the chapters of the book that cover them, as well as an epilogue with a surprisingly philosophical outlook on IT security and trust in human societies.</p>

<p>The writing was clear and to the point, with tons of footnotes and references to provide the interested reader with the chance to further research the presented topics. The author clearly knows what he's talking about and manages to present it in a very approachable way. Due to it's limited size the book still has to be a bit dense though, so I never really felt like reading more than one chapter at a time, otherwise it'd have been to much information to take in at once.</p>

<p>Whether you work in IT security or are a web application developer, this definitely is a book you don't want to miss.</p>

    <updated>2012-02-01T22:03:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/02/01/review-a-bug-hunters-diary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a very good read! In each chapter the author introduces one bug he found in a popular software package, always following the same structure: discovery, exploitation, remediation, lessons learned from the bug and a timeline of the bug's lifetime (disclosure, fix, etc).</p>

<p>The writing is engaging and to the point, but still contains a lot of technical detail. Be warned though, if reading C and disassembly is not your type of thing, you probably won't enjoy this too much. The author tries hard to make everything as easy to understand as possible, but there's only so much you can do with limited space.</p>

<p>If there's anything to criticize about this book, it's that the chapters are fairly repetitive, so I never really felt like reading more than one in a single sitting. But then it's also not the type of book that needs to be read cover to cover as fast as possible.</p>
