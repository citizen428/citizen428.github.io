    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in October I broke my trusty old <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HZYA6E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004HZYA6E&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=citizen4blog-20">Kindle Keyboard</a>, a rather
annoying thing to happen at the beginning of a long trip. As a
workaround I started to use the Kindle app on my iPod Touch, and while
I did manage to finish several books on it, it&rsquo;s a bit annoying to
read on such a small screen. So I decided to get a new device, but
which one? Either the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008UB7DU6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008UB7DU6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=citizen4blog-20">Kindle Paperwhite</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GGCAVM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008GGCAVM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=citizen4blog-20">Kindle Fire</a> or maybe
just an iPad or an Android tablet with the Kindle app?</p>

<p><strong>Tablet or Kindle?</strong></p>

<p>Lately I got a lot more serious about my chess playing, so I own
several books on the topic in digital form. Needless to say, they
don&rsquo;t do too well on a &ldquo;classical&rdquo; Kindle, so I started considering a
Fire or other tablet. Once I started thinking along those lines,
another group of publications came to mind, comics and graphic
novels. I used to love and collect them, but eventually stopped
because they just take up way too much space. Nowadays a lot of
publishers do have digital editions though, so this became the point
where the Paperwhite got thrown out of the race.</p>

<p><strong>The decision process</strong></p>

<p>So I knew I wanted a tablet, and I knew I wanted something small. This
left me with four contestants, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GGCAVM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008GGCAVM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=citizen4blog-20">Kindle Fire HD 7"</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00746W3HG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00746W3HG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=citizen4blog-20">iPad Mini</a>,
the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009X3UW2G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009X3UW2G&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=citizen4blog-20">Nexus 7</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007P4VOWC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007P4VOWC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=citizen4blog-20">Galaxy Tab 2 7"</a>.</p>

<p>I like Apple products, but I wasn&rsquo;t really willing to shell out the
money for an iPad Mini (although you can get them for as little as 300
bucks at Wallmart at the moment). One down, three to go. Now for the
Nexus 7. It&rsquo;s a powerful Android device and also caters to the &ldquo;power
user&rdquo;, whatever that&rsquo;s worth in the tablet world. Alas I found a ton
of comments and posts about quality issues (DOA, glass coming off the
screens, devices having to be RMA&rsquo;d after only two weeks etc.) so I
was hesitant to get one, because the last thing I need while traveling
is carrying around a dead device while trying to get it replaced. Also
at $250 it was only $50 cheaper than an iPad Mini.</p>

<p>That left the Kindle Fire HD and the Galaxy Tab 2, the latter of which
is ridiculously cheap by now (the cheapest I saw was $150 with a
cover), but it&rsquo;s also not exactly the newest piece of hardware. I
still was leaning in the direction of the more general device
though&hellip; Until I walked into a Radioshack during our layover in
Florida, saw the Kindle Fire HD and bought it. Damn you, instant
gratification!</p>

<p><strong>First impressions</strong></p>

<p>When I turned it on for the first time, I was amazed. The display is
good, and I mean really good! As are the Dolby speakers. In short, I
find the audio and video quality to be pretty amazing for a 7 inch
device. Reading with the Kindle app is a pleasure, as is watching
movies and listening to music. I actually really enjoy watching stuff
on the Kindle Fire, much more than I expected on such a small screen.</p>

<p>But then I started to explore a bit more, and I got disappointed
rather fast. Amazon&rsquo;s user interface clearly was only built for two
purposes: shopping and consuming content. The Kindle Fire is not meant
to be a full-fledged Android tablet, it&rsquo;s a portable frontend to the
Amazon store and cloud. Starting from the ads which get displayed when
you wake up the device (I know, you can pay to have them removed),
over the unavailability of many apps in Amazon&rsquo;s app store (for
example all Google apps like GMail or Google Maps) to the extremely
content focused UI, everything screams &ldquo;Consume!&rdquo; in a rather shrill
and annoying voice.</p>

<p><strong>Making it work for me</strong></p>

<p>Luckily, there are lots of things you can do to make the Kindle Fire a
lot more interesting, even without rooting it (something I really
can&rsquo;t be bothered to do while on the road).</p>

<p>First off, you will need an alternative app store. After some research
I settled on <a href="http://slideme.org/">SlideME</a>, mostly because they actually check the
applications they are offering, thus alleviating some of the security
concerns I had about other offerings. Next I got myself a decent file
manager in the form of <a href="http://slideme.org/application/es-file-explorer">ES File Explorer</a>, before setting out to
find a decent browser. Yes, a browser, because somehow Amazon&rsquo;s own
offering, called Silk, doesn&rsquo;t really cut it for me. It has good
features, but I found it to be rather sluggish. And I had some privacy
concerns about the cloud rendering, euphemistically called &ldquo;Accelerate
Page Loading&rdquo; in the settings. Sure, you can choose to encrypt the
data or disable this &ldquo;feature&rdquo; completely, but it did leave a somewhat
bitter aftertaste. Most people seem to prefer <a href="http://slideme.org/application/dolphin-browser-0">Dolphin</a> or similar
offerings for their Android devices, but I settled for the good old
Firefox (or rather Aurora) in its <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/aurora/">mobile incarnation</a>. It&rsquo;s a solid app
and so far provides everything I need, including a direct download
from the website. This is how I interact with Google apps for the time
being, I just use their mobile versions in the browser.</p>

<p>App store fixed, file manager acquired, browser fixed, on to the
horrible UI. Unfortunately there&rsquo;s not really too much you can do in
this regard, but I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VN7BRC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004VN7BRC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=citizen4blog-20">Smart Taskbar</a> to be a huge
improvement. It has a small icon for triggering the app from
everywhere and features quick launch for up to five apps, configurable
labels and much more. Not as good as having a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Android
interface, but definitely much better than the standard Kindle Fire
offering.</p>

<p>Last but not least I installed <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/android">Dropbox</a> for easier file exchange, which
is super easy because there&rsquo;s a direct download link on the web
site. I wish more developers would do this&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>More content</strong></p>

<p>Once I was done with the basics, it was time to add more content
sources/viewers. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UBB1HQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004UBB1HQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=citizen4blog-20">ComiCat</a> is an exzellent CBR/CBZ reader and I
highly recommend it for managing and reading your digital
comics. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VVSQU4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005VVSQU4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=citizen4blog-20">ComiXology</a> (and its app Comics) also is a good addition,
especially since they have a rather well stocked online store and a
decent read-by-panel feature. Both of these apps are available in
Amazon&rsquo;s app store ($3 for ComiCat, Comics is for free).</p>

<p>For access to more books I added the <a href="http://slideme.org/application/gutenberg-ereader">Gutenberg eReader</a> app, a frontend
to the well-known Project Gutenberg, as well as the <a href="http://slideme.org/application/nook">NOOK</a>
software. Yes, NOOK, on a Kindle. As you can imagine this did not come
from the official app store but from SlideME instead. Since I&rsquo;m
usually really happy with Amazon&rsquo;s offerings I&rsquo;m not even sure I&rsquo;ll
use it, but it&rsquo;s nice to have a choice and apparently the NOOK store
has a dedicated comic section, so who knows&hellip;</p>

<p>On to movies. While Amazon&rsquo;s streaming service is great (or so I&rsquo;ve
heard), it&rsquo;s of no use to me while traveling. I do however have quite
a few films and documentaries on my netbook (go check out <a href="http://vodo.net/">VODO</a>,
there&rsquo;s some great free stuff on there), but I don&rsquo;t want to convert
all of them to a format the Kindle understands. Enter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AHQNHSY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00AHQNHSY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=citizen4blog-20">MoboPlayer</a>, a
great free movie player that can deal with a ton of formats and even
has a windowed mode. Yes, on a tablet!</p>

<p>With comics, books and movies covered, what&rsquo;s left? Games! The guys
over at <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> don&rsquo;t only compile great game bundles, they
also have a nifty <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/app">Android app</a>, that let&rsquo;s you manage all your
purchases. Since they offered several Android bundles in the past I
actually have a ton of games, and the Kindle Fire is an excellent
device to play them on.</p>

<p>Of course I have a lot more apps than that (Instapaper, Twitter,
Flipboard, LinkedIn etc.) but they all come from the official app
store and don&rsquo;t really need any explanation here.</p>

<p><strong>Final verdict</strong></p>

<p>After I got over my initial frustrations, I REALLY like my Kindle
Fire. I guess it&rsquo;s all about expectation management. This is not a
productivity device, it&rsquo;s a gadget for consuming media in all its
forms. I especially love reading comics and graphic novels on it, the
colors are great, and the resolution is high enough to actually be
able to enjoy them, even on a rather small screen. It&rsquo;s also great for
watching movies or listening to music and audiobooks, and since it&rsquo;s a
Kindle, reading eBooks is a pleasure too once you configured the app
to your liking.</p>

<p>The hardware is fantastic (especially for $200) and the battery life
(around 10-11h) is great. I don&rsquo;t exclude the possibility of rooting
it in the future and maybe even flashing a different ROM, but for now
I take the Kindle Fire for what it is and thoroughly enjoy it that
way: during a bus ride the other day I read a book, watched a video,
and read some comics, all on the same device.</p>

    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/07/28/review-ruby-and-mongodb-web-development/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-28T10:15:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2012/07/28/review-ruby-and-mongodb-web-development</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I was one of the technical editors of this book, so I may be biased.</p>

<p>While I haven&rsquo;t received <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/ruby-and-mongodb-web-development-beginners-guide/book">the book</a> in its final form yet, I&rsquo;ve read all of it, and I can say that the author does a good job at introducing inexperienced programmers to web development with Ruby and MongoDB.</p>

<p>This is a hands-on book and you&rsquo;ll get most out of it by following all the exercises and doing them on your own. From getting all the necessary components and installing them, to developing apps with Sinatra and Rails, a lot of ground is covered.</p>

<p>While the author does tackle some more advanced topics, they are clearly not the focus of this book (it&rsquo;s subtitled &ldquo;Beginner&rsquo;s Guide&rdquo; for a reason) which will leave more experienced developers wanting for more. However, the presented material is well written, chapters build on each other and if you are new to web development with Ruby/RoR and/or MongoDB, this is a good title to get you up to speed in just 300 pages.</p>

<p>If you are a more experienced Ruby developer or are already very familiar with MongoDB, this is probably not the book for you, even though you&rsquo;ll probably still get something out of it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer 1: The good folks of No Starch Press were kind enough to provide me with a review copy of this book, but this did not influence the following text.</em></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer 2: Links to books are Amazon affiliate links.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in IT security for a long time, but obviously even more so since I started working professionally in this area. Since web applications have become ubiquitous in recent years, they constitute a big part of our penetration testing work. This is a very broad topic, so <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593273886/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=citizen4blog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593273886">The Tangled Web: A Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=citizen4blog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1593273886" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Michal Zalewski is an ambitious project.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was that the book is comparatively thin. At around 300 pages it&rsquo;s only about one third of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026470/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=citizen4blog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118026470">The Web Application Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook: Finding and Exploiting Security Flaws</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=citizen4blog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1118026470" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Don&rsquo;t let that fool you though, this book is not a lightweight by any means. It&rsquo;s logically structured in three parts, the first of which explores the various components that constitute the web as we know it today (URLs, HTTP, HTML, CSS etc.) and their security implications. This is followed by a look at the security features — and their shortcomings — of current browsers. After this part 3 deals with current developments and the future of browser and web application security. This is rounded off by a list of common security problems including references to the chapters of the book that cover them, as well as an epilogue with a surprisingly philosophical outlook on IT security and trust in human societies.</p>

<p>The writing was clear and to the point, with tons of footnotes and references to provide the interested reader with the chance to further research the presented topics. The author clearly knows what he&rsquo;s talking about and manages to present it in a very approachable way. Due to it&rsquo;s limited size the book still has to be a bit dense though, so I never really felt like reading more than one chapter at a time, otherwise it&rsquo;d have been to much information to take in at once.</p>

<p>Whether you work in IT security or are a web application developer, this definitely is a book you don&rsquo;t want to miss.</p>
