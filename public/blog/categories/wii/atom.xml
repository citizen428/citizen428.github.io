    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you may know I&rsquo;m a big fan of video game consoles. I currently own two &ldquo;NES&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES,</a> a &ldquo;SNES&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNES,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNES,</a> a &ldquo;Mega Drive&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Drive">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Drive</a>  (aka Genesis), a &ldquo;PS1&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playstation,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playstation,</a> a &ldquo;Dreamcast&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast,</a> a &ldquo;Game Cube&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Cube">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Cube</a> and loads of games. I also played quite a lot on the other systems common in Europe (&ldquo;Saturn&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn,</a> &ldquo;N64&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N64,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N64,</a> &ldquo;PS2&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS2,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS2,</a> &ldquo;Xbox&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox</a>). Among the listed systems, the Dreamcast is probably still my favorite for being really innovative and having lots of great games, with the GC coming in a close second. But I&rsquo;ve had great times with all of them - the original Mario Kart on the SNES and most Square titles on the PS1 come to mind. Of course I also love handhelds and own an original &ldquo;Game Boy&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy</a> (which is unfortunately broken), a &ldquo;GBA&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBA">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBA</a> and a black &ldquo;Nintendo DS LIte&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Lite,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Lite,</a> which IMHO is the coolest portable gaming system I&rsquo;ve ever seen (with honorable mentions for the &ldquo;Sega Nomad&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Nomad">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Nomad</a> and the &ldquo;Turbo Express&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Express">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Express</a>).</p>

<p>As you can see I own everything Nintendo ever made except for the N64, which too had a lot of great games but which I somehow never bought. And I really love their products. But I also was always very fond of Sega&rsquo;s systems, and when the company announced that they wouldn&rsquo;t produce any more consoles after the DC, I was pretty sure that I won&rsquo;t buy another game console ever. That held true for a surprisingly long time, until I got myself a GC at the beginning of this year, because (1) the console fever got me again and (2) it was ridiculously cheap because it was already close to the end of it&rsquo;s life cycle. And although I currently hardly take the time to play with the systems I already own, I&rsquo;m considering buying a &ldquo;seventh generation console&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games_%28seventh_generation_era%29.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games_%28seventh_generation_era%29.</a></p>

<p>Ladies and gentleman, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Xbox 360&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360</a> vs &ldquo;PS3&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3</a> vs. &ldquo;Wii&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii.</a> I&rsquo;m definitely not going to get myself a PS3. First off I&rsquo;m not interested in Blu-ray, HDMI and the other fancy stuff, and secondly I think &ldquo;Sony sucks&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Copy_Protection.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Copy_Protection.</a> Besides that at least two of my friends will get one, so I can play the newest &ldquo;PES&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Evolution_Soccer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Evolution_Soccer</a> or &ldquo;GTA&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29</a> with them. So of course the Wii would be an obvious choice: it has &ldquo;Twilight Princess&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess,</a> is made by Nintendo and features this incredibly cool controller. And did I mention  &ldquo;Twilight Princess&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess?">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess?</a> Besides that it offers wireless, the option to play my GC games (I could save a little room by storing the GC someplace else), a cool download feature and I&rsquo;m sure there will be interesting possibilities to use it in conjunction with the DS. But yesterday I suddenly realized that I never considered the Xbox 360. None of my friends has one, and nobody mentioned any plans to buy it. So I read up on it a little, and somehow I started to like the system. Sure, it&rsquo;s made by &ldquo;the big evil company&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</a> and it doesn&rsquo;t exactly offer original games. But it has &ldquo;Gears of War&rdquo;:<a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/744/744356p1.html,">http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/744/744356p1.html,</a> &ldquo;F.E.A.R&rdquo;:<a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/741/741860p1.html,">http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/741/741860p1.html,</a> &ldquo;Prey&rdquo;:<a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/717/717824p1.html">http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/717/717824p1.html</a> and a lot more good shooters. And I really like playing shooters. Then there&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oblivion&rdquo;:<a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/698/698400p1.html,">http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/698/698400p1.html,</a> which by itself may justify getting a 360. Considering the upcoming &ldquo;Halo 3&rdquo;:<a href="http://halo3.com/">http://halo3.com/</a> and &ldquo;Star Trek Legacy&rdquo;:<a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/707/707567p1.html,">http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/707/707567p1.html,</a> the system might well be worth its money for me. Plus I&rsquo;ve never owned a Microsoft console. Actually I was pretty sure I never will, but since &ldquo;colo&rdquo;:<a href="http://gnulords.org/~colo/">http://gnulords.org/~colo/</a> mentioned that he&rsquo;s interested in a PSP, I&rsquo;m surprised by anything anymore.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m still pondering wether to buy a new console or not, but if I do, I&rsquo;m not sure anymore that I will be a Wii.</p>
