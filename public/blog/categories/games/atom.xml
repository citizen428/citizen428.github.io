    <updated>2011-10-05T20:55:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2011/10/05/awesome-indie-games</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I used to be a big gamer, especially when it came to console games. Nowadays I don't have much time for that anymore, but I'm still quite interested in gaming culture and games as a medium. I'm especially fond of indie games, since their authors can afford to explore stranger concepts than more mainstream development teams. Here's a list of some of my favorites, most (all?) of which should be available on Windows, Mac and Linux:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.andyetitmoves.net/">And Yet It Moves</a>: Awesome physics-based platformer, featuring a very unique design.</li>
<li><a href="http://blendogames.com/atomzombiesmasher/">Atom Zombie Smasher</a>: Probably my absolute favorite at the moment. Great presentation, awesome music and an interesting twist on the tower defense genre.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.braid-game.com/">Braid</a>: Cute puzzle game that utilizes time as a central element of the game mechanics.</li>
<li><a href="http://crayonphysics.com/">Crayon Physics Delux</a>: Ok, I'm a sucker for physics based games, and this is no exception. The great visual style definitely helps.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.desktopdungeons.net/">Desktop Dungeons</a>: While the developers are working on a "proper" version now, the original alpha is still available for free. Think of it as the bare essence of rogue-likes.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hemispheregames.com/osmos/">Osmos</a>: I really like this one for it's almost meditative quality.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fargoal.com/">Sword of Fargoal Legend</a>: Another dungeon crawler that proves that good game mechanics are more important than fancy graphics.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.traumagame.com/">Trauma</a>: Maybe the most unique game in this list, this point and click adventure deals with the psychological trauma of a young woman who survived a car crash. Eerie atmosphere, great presentation.</li>
<li><a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/">VVVVVV</a>: A 2d puzzle platformer that I'm quite fond of. Messing with gravity while listening to chiptune music? Count me in!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofgoo.com/">World of Goo</a>: The cute Gooballs alone are a reason to play this one.</li>
</ul>
