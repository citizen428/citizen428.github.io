    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since too many of life's pleasures are demonized by all the greyfaces out there, I've decided to start a new series called "In defense of", where I'll collect quotes, song lyrics, etc. which show them in a different - and maybe more positive - way.</p>

<p><i><em>Kikizo:</em> So, how many drinks does it take for ideas to stop being feasible, good ideas, and start being just complete nonsense?</p>

<p><em>Itagaki:</em> Haha! It's hard to say, because I am drinking pretty much full-time. Of course, there are ups and downs, waves, of how I drink in terms of the amount, but it's a long period of time. In the last ten years - not that you asked this question - I think I had better ideas when I was drinking whisky. When I am drinking shochu, that's a conservative drink, so the ideas are not that great. Beer is just like water to me, so it just helps me and everyone else loosen up a little bit, it doesn't really contribute to coming up with ideas.</i> (found on "Ars Technica":http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2006/7/4/4522)</p>

<p><em>BOUNCING SOULS</em>
<i>"I Started Drinking Again"</p>

<p>Since I started drinkin' again
Since I started drinkin' again
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you
Since I started drinkin' again</p>

<p>I know that the neighbors are all a-talkin'
They swear that I have lost my mind
Ah, but they do not know
That I've just gained control
Of all the heartache that you left behind</p>

<p>[Chorus:]
Since I started drinkin' again
Since I started drinkin' again
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you
Since I started drinkin' again</p>

<p>Well I know that the boss is gonna fire me
When I stumble in late to work again
But surprise will replace that old scowl on his face
When he sees that I do not give a damn</p>

<p>[Chorus:]
Since I started drinkin' again
Since I started drinkin' again
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you
Since I started drinkin' again</p>

<p>I ain't shed one lousy tear over you
Since I started drinkin'
Since I started drinkin'
Since I started drinkin' again
