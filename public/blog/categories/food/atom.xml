    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Saturday, February 18:</em>
"teemow":http://www.teemow.de and "Steffi":http://flickr.com/photos/peppertwin/ came from Cologne to Vienna. Spent the night at "B72":http://b72.at/, "Chelsea":http://www.chelsea.co.at/ and "Elektro Gönner":http://www.elektro-g.at/. Nice.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, February 19:</em>
Had a decent brunch with my girlfriend at "Restaurant Leopold":http://www.restaurant-leopold.at/. Then had some coffee at the "Bluebox":http://www.bluebox.at/ with teemow, Steffi and Laki. The "Coheed and Cambrea" concert in the evening got postponed again, so I went to the "Einhorn" with my former flatmate Doris to have some beers...</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, February 21:</em>
Attended the IT Suppliers Day of one of our customers. Went to Laki's place with my girlfriend in the evening to have some Caipiroskas with him, teemow and Steffi.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday, February 22:</em>
Met my co-conspirators (details to follow) "berq":http://berq.net/blog/ and "colo":http://gnulords.org/~colo/serendipity/ (who now has a blog too) at the Käuzchen. Got drunk again, but it was definitely worth it... ;)</p>

<p><em>Friday, February 24:</em>
Had some great lunch - Seafood Soup and Walleye In White Wine Sauce - at Alberto's with my boss and the "WCM":http://www.wcm.at guys. I'll do a nice article series for them starting in June. More info will follow.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, February 25:</em>
Went to the office for a workshop (around 2,5 hours), which was actually pretty informative and nice. Started reading "The Cocka Hola Company":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/3453400526/026-7600414-8433267 and love it.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, February 26:</em>
Had brunch with Karin and Andi at the "Lux":http://lokaltipp.at/lokale/homepage_9_1034, which IMHO offers one of the best breakfast deals in town (all you can eat buffet with <em>great</em> antipasti and lots of other good stuff for Euro 8,40!). Highly recommended!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Personal:</em>
Yesterday I had the last seminar of my university "career", which feels kind of strange. As the people who know me better can tell you, for the past few years I've always been torn between a job in the technical field and pursuing an academic career in humanities. Now that I've surprisingly found a job which allows me to work full time on/with free software, it seems that this decision has finally been made, but there still is a certain amount of uncertainty...</p>

<p><em>Food:</em>
During yesterday's lunch break we've been to a nice "Korean restaurant":http://falter.at/web/wwei/detail.php?nr=679&amp;ref=bezirk%3D9%26kueche%3D231%26teil%3D1 which offers nice set meals (consisting of "miso soup":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miso_soup, a salad and a main course) in the range of 6,20-10,20 Euro. The beef "bibimbap":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibimbap is great and everything else also was really good.</p>

<p>In the evening we've ordered a nice pizza which goes really well with Friday night TV, and today I'll meet some friends at the "Blunzenstricker":http://www.blunzenstricker.at/ to have some solid Austrian food. :)</p>

<p><em>Books:</em>
I've just finished J.G. Ballard's "Millenium People":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/000225848X/002-3286426-3377608?v=glance&amp;n=283155 which I wholeheartedly recommend to everyone! Currently I'm reading "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345404475/qid=1139069018/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-3286426-3377608?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155 by Philip K. Dick, which is long overdue given that I have seen "Blade Runner":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/ a gazillion times but never actually came around to read the book.</p>

<p>As it's pretty thin I went to a book store today and came home with "The Cocka Hola company":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/3453400526/202-6097115-8739022 by Matias Faldbakken, "Vernon God Little":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156029987/qid=1139068428/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/002-3286426-3377608?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155 by DBC Pierre and Alan Bisset's "The incredible Adam Spark":http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/incredibleadamspark.html.</p>

    <updated>2005-11-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2005/11/27/hooray-for-turkish-food</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you know me, you also know how much I love food. I can't think of many things which are better than spending a nice evening with friends in a restaurant, having a great dinner and an interesting conversation.</p>

<p>My favorite food definitely comes from East Asian cuisines, which may or may not have to do with the fact that I've lived in China for a while. It's hard to choose between "Chinese":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine, "Japanese":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cuisine or "Korean":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_cuisine food, because all of these countries have great dishes: "Gongbao jiding":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_pao_chicken anyone? Or do you prefer some "Yakitori":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakitori? Or maybe have some "Bulgogi":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgogi...</p>

<p>Now that we've established that East Asian food is just great, it's time to talk about "another country's great cuisine":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_food/: Turkey! Yep, I just love Turkish food! Come on, they have "Döner Kebab":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%B6ner_Kebab, Dürüm Kebab, "Lahmacun":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahmacun (a kind of pizza), "cacik":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzatziki, Köfte (delicious meatballs), "Dolma":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolma, "Börek":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrek and lots of other great stuff. And don't even get me started on the desserts... "Baklava":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava and "Helva":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halvah, followed by some nice "Turkish coffee":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee. And I haven't even talked about "Ayran":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayran and all the other great Turkish food and drinks that come to my mind... Luckily enough Austria (and to an even larger extent Germany) has lots of Turkish fast-food joints and restaurants, so I just can go and get me one of my favorite dishes whenever I feel like it. :) BTW: "Berg":http://berq.net/, if you're reading this, invite me for dinner and cook some great Turkish food... ;)</p>

<p>To finish off this topic I'll give you some links to a type of food which is almost too good to really be true, namely the "Uighur":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uighur cuisine, which combines elements from Chinese, Turkish and Arabic food: "Uighur Food":http://www.wiu.edu/users/mua/food.htm, "The Uighurs - Cuisine":http://the_uighurs.tripod.com/UighurCuisine.htm and "Xinjiang-Style Cuisine":http://www.chinavista.com/experience/xinjiang/cuisine.html.</p>
