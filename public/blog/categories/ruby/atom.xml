    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's no secret that I'm rather fond of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> and also try to apply it to my Ruby coding, at least as long as it doesn't become too unidiomatic.</p>

<p>Being at home sick I got bored, so I played around a bit in IRB to create a composition function that will allow me to create higher-order functions in a <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pointfree">pointfree style</a> (sometimes also referred to as "pointless style", hence the title of this post). I know that <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/">Facets</a> has <code>Proc#compose</code> and <code>Proc#*</code>, but they only work with <code>Proc</code> objects. Ruby being the flexible beast that it is, it took me about two minutes to come up with a working solution, which I called <code>fn</code> because it basically returns a function and <code>compose</code> was too long for my taste:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">funs</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">funs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">inject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Here it is in action:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;foo bar&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;baz qux&quot;</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">map</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">amp</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">fn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:split</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:last</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/p&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>I know that this isn't really shorter than <code>{ |x| x.split.last }</code>, but usefullness isn't really the goal of a pointless exercise ;-)</p>

<p>So far so good, but if one doesn't really care about pointfree style, wouldn't it also be fun to mix and match procs and symbols? It sure would:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>

<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">funs</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;funs.inject(x) do |v, f|</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  Proc === f ? f.call(v) : v.send(f)</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">end</span>

<p>Let's see this in action:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Note: I'm sick, all of this is untested, does not take into account corner cases of any kind and may harm your pet. It was however a fun little diversion that showed once again how flexible Ruby is.</p>

    <updated>2011-11-23T20:43:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2011/11/23/ruby-github-projects-atom-feed</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I found an <a href="http://xach.livejournal.com/298220.html">interesting post</a> by Lisper extraordinaire <a href="http://xach.livejournal.com/">Zach Beane</a> on <a href="http://planet.lisp.org/">Planet Lisp</a>, where he describes his program to generate a feed for the <a href="https://github.com/languages/Common%20Lisp/created">GitHub page about recently created Common Lisp repos</a>.</p>

<p>Since good artists borrow and great artists steal, I decided to do the latter with his idea and implemented something similar for the <a href="https://github.com/languages/Ruby/created">new Ruby repos</a>. It uses <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/open-uri/rdoc/">open-uri</a> for fetching the page, <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> for parsing it and <a href="http://builder.rubyforge.org/">Builder</a> for generating the Atom feed.</p>

<p>``` ruby
require 'open-uri'
require 'nokogiri'
require 'builder'</p>

<p>html = open("https://github.com/languages/Ruby/created")
doc = Nokogiri::HTML.parse(html)</p>

<p>atom = Builder::XmlMarkup.new(:target => STDOUT, :indent => 2)
atom.instruct!
atom.feed "xmlns" => "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" do
  atom.id "urn:citizen428:github:newrepos"
  atom.updated Time.now.utc.iso8601(0)
  atom.title "New GitHub Ruby Repos", :type => "text"
  atom.link :rel => "self", :href => "/ruby_github.atom"
  doc.xpath("//table[@class='repo']/tr/td[@class='title']/a").each do |title|</p>

<pre><code>name = title.content
owner = title.at_xpath("../../td[@class='owner']/a").content
desc = title.at_xpath("../../following-sibling::tr/td[@class='desc']").content
date = Time.parse(title.at_xpath("../../td[@class='date']").content)
atom.entry do
  atom.title "#{owner}: #{name}"
  atom.author { atom.name owner }
  atom.link "href" =&gt; "https://github.com#{title.attributes["href"].value}"
  atom.id "urn:citizen428:github:#{owner}:#{name}"
  atom.published date.utc.iso8601(0)
  atom.updated date.utc.iso8601(0)
  atom.content desc, :type =&gt; "html"
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>I'm hosting <a href="http://citizen428.net/ruby_github.atom">the feed</a> on this blog (updated regularly via cron), add it to your feed reader to discover potentially interesting new Ruby projects.</p>

    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2011/11/22/a-little-pow-helper/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-22T21:08:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2011/11/22/a-little-pow-helper</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are a Ruby developer on MacOS X, you probably love <a href="http://pow.cx">Pow</a> as much as I do. While skimming the <a href="http://pow.cx/manual.html">fine manual</a> today, I noticed <a href="http://pow.cx/manual.html#section_3.2">section 3.2</a>, "Reading the Current Configuration", which explains that you can query Pow's config and status via simple HTTP requests:</p>

<p><code>bash Query Pow's status http://pow.cx/manual.html#section_3.2 Pow manual
curl -H host:pow localhost/status.json
</code></p>

<p>Since I know I'd probably forget that sooner than later, I immediately wrapped it up in a small script, which I called <code>pow-show</code> and put in <code>~/bin</code>:</p>

<p>``` ruby ~/bin/pow-show</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/env ruby</h1>

<p>require 'json'</p>

<p>unless %w(status config).include?(ARGV[0])
  puts "Usage: #{File.basename($0)} status|config"
  exit 1
end</p>

<p>jj JSON.parse(<code>curl -s -H host:pow localhost/#{ARGV[0]}.json</code>)
```</p>

<p>Here's some example output:</p>

<p><code>javascript pow-show status
{
  "pid": 802,
  "version": "0.3.2",
  "requestCount": 134
}
</code></p>

<p>``` javascript pow-show config
{
  "bin": "/Users/name/Library/Application Support/Pow/Versions/0.3.2/bin/pow",
  "dstPort": 80,
  "httpPort": 20559,
  "dnsPort": 20560,
  "timeout": 900,
  "workers": 2,
  "domains": [</p>

<pre><code>"dev"
</code></pre>

<p>  ],
  "extDomains": [</p>

<p>  ],
  "hostRoot": "/Users/name/Library/Application Support/Pow/Hosts",
  "logRoot": "/Users/name/Library/Logs/Pow",
  "rvmPath": "/Users/name/.rvm/scripts/rvm"
}
```</p>

<p>Maybe that's useful for someone else too.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Frozen Rails recap]]></title>
    <link href="http://citizen428.net/blog/2011/09/24/frozen-rails-recap/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-24T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2011/09/24/frozen-rails-recap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent the first half of this week in Helsinki at the excellent "Frozen Rails":https://frozenrails.eu/ conference and thought I'd share some impressions with you:</p>

<p><em>Monday:</em> when we (team "Tupalo":http://tupalo.com that is) finally got to the pre-opening event it was rather empty already, but we managed to collect the leftovers and get a party going that was very fun and helped in getting to know many people quickly. Later that night we picked up a jet lagged Ryan Smith ("Heroku":http://heroku.com) from his hotel and stayed out much longer than we should have... ;-)</p>

<p><em>Tuesday:</em> Arriving at Finlandia hall still a bit hungover, I soon got very excited by what I saw around me. The conference is rather small, which in my opinion is one of its strongest points, since it's very easy to actually get to talk to a lot of the attendees. The overall atmosphere is very amicable, so you barely ever feel like you are intruding on someone when you strike up a random conversation. Talk-wise it started with Geoffrey Grosenbach's ("PeepCode":http://peepcode.com/) "keynote":https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#geoffrey, which was nice but not overly exciting. This was followed by a spontaneous talk by Jeff Kasimir ("Jumpstart Lab":http://jumpstartlab.com/) titled "The Problem Is In Your Ruby", which was absolutely fantastic. I also got a chance to talk to Jeff about potential cooperations with "RubyLearning":http://rubylearning.org later, let's see if that gets anywhere. I then took a couple of hours off for some socializing, before watching Jeff's second talk "Blow Up Your Views":https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#jeff. The last talk I saw that day was by the "Travis CI":http://travis-ci.org/ team and I enjoyed it so much that I immediately switched one of my own projects to Travis. After the conference we had dinner in the excellent "Soul Kitchen":http://www.soulkitchen.fi/, followed by some drinks at "A21":http://www.a21.fi/ and "Bar Loose":http://www.barloose.com/.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday:</em> Despite a lack of sleep I dragged myself to Richard White's ("UserVoice":http://uservoice.com/) "keynote":https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#richard, who talked about startups and entrepreneurship. That was followed by the very interesting "How GitHub Uses GitHub to Build GitHub":https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#zach by Zach Holman ("GitHub":http://github.com, surprise). I then spent some time hacking a little on a bit of Ruby code for my lightning talk, but went to see Ryan Smith's talk on how stuff works at Heroku. After the coffee break I sat in "Joseph Ruscio's" ("Librato":https://silverline.librato.com/) talk "Implementing a RESTful API with Ruby the Right Way":https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#joseph_ruscio, but I must admit that I was a bit tired and didn't pay as much attention as the talk deserved. The last talk was my personal favorite, "Debugging Ruby Performance":https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#aman by GitHub's Aman Gupta (I have some notes as an Emacs org-file "on GitHub":https://github.com/citizen428/study-notes/blob/master/ruby-perfomance/ruby-perfomance.org). The conference ended with some lightning talks, including our own on hack weeks at Tupalo. For dinner Heroku invited some 25 or so people to the expensive "Hotel K&auml;mp":http://www.hotelkamp.fi/, where I spent most of the time talking to Topfunky and his friends. We then went over to "Le Bonk":http://www.lebonk.fi/ to join the GitHub drink up, but due to a non-disclosure agreement with myself no details about this evening will be made public ;-)</p>

<p>All in all a very nice and well organized conference, that for me has the perfect size. Congrats and thanks to the team for organizing such an awesome event! BTW: someone set up a "GitHub repository":https://github.com/i0rek/frozenrails-notes with Frozen Rails slides, photos and notes, check it out!</p>
