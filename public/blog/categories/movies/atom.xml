    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another "Viennale":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_International_Film_Festival has finished, time for a little recap of the five movies we saw this year:</p>

<ul>
    <li>"Los labios":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637694/ (Ivan Fund & Santiago Loza)<br>
This had potential, but didn't really live up to it. Usually I'm all for mixing professional and amateur actors, but in this case it didn't work for me. A documentary on this topic would probably haven been more interesting.</li>
    <li>"Vincere":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156173/ (Marco Bellocchio)<br>
Probably my favorite movie of this year's festival. An interesting - and true - story, great acting and beautiful presentation, what more can you ask for?
</li>
    <li>"Un homme qui crie":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1639901/ (Mahamat-Saleh Haroun)<br />
A solid movie about present-day Chad. Told in a very dry manner, I really enjoyed the first half of this, but found it a bit of a drag towards the end. The lead actor was great though!</li>
    <li>"The Oath":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1522857/ (Laura Poitras)<br />
A documentary about two men from Yemen who worked for Osama Bin Laden. I found this very interesting and as always it's good to hear the other side of a story.</li>
    <li>"Engkwentro":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1424053/ (Pepe Diokno)<br>
The life of two brothers in a ghetto somewhere in the Philippine - violence, drugs and gangs. This seems to have been made with a fairly low budget, and the nervous handheld camera may upset some people. Overall it was pretty interesting though and I'm glad we saw this.
</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I've been to the cinema for the first time in quite a while and watched "Babel":http://imdb.com/title/tt0449467/ by "Alejandro González Iñárritu":http://imdb.com/name/nm0327944/ of "Amores perros":http://imdb.com/title/tt0245712/ and "21 Grams":http://imdb.com/title/tt0315733/ fame. Once again Iñárritu's unexcited story telling is a welcome change from the fancy camera work and editing which got so popular in the last few years and serves the - sometimes a little too predictable - story well. The acting ranges between solid and excellent, and I especially liked the performance of "Rinko Kikuchi":http://imdb.com/name/nm1946248/ who excels in the role of disturbed teenager Chieko.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished watching "Rounders":http://imdb.com/title/tt0128442/ about half an hour ago, which is a really nice Poker movie and quite entertaining in general. Although the plot is a little too predictable at times, the great cast including Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Turturro and John Malkovich more than makes up for it. The soundtrack was pretty cool too, so I decided to also order it along with a DVD of "The Cincinnati Kid":http://imdb.com/title/tt0059037/.</p>

<p>For additional Poker entertainment season 3 of "High Stakes Poker":http://www.gsn.com/hsp started not too long ago and the first three episodes have been pretty good, although I'm already quite fed up by Mike Matusow's constant babbling. I'm just not that happy with the player selection for the current season, since Phil Ivey and Gus Hansen are missing and I'd also love to see one of my personal favorites, Chris Esfandiari. Nonetheless I find HSP a lot more entertaining than NBC's "Poker After Dark":http://www.nbcsports.com/poker/index.html, which had a great start when Phil Hellmuth was going ballistic in the very first episode.</p>

<p>I also found a really interesting thread on the 2+2 forums, where "Nate." took on the challenge in turning $5 into $1000 in less than a week on PokerStars. I really wonder if the $5 Stars recently transferred to my account - I've only been playing Party and FullTilt lately - should be treated as a sign to try the same? ;)</p>

<p>Oh, and for the title of this post: It's a quote from Rounders, and it's as true as it gets.</p>
