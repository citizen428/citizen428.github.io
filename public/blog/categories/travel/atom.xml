    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last time I promised you all a bit more information about backpacking on a Caribbean island, so here we go: before we set out, we didn't exactly know how much time to plan for Curacao, so we decided on 12 days, which also had to do with P.'s birthday. Considering this island isn't too big this seems like a rather long time, but things here are slow, especially when travelling on a budget...</p>

<p>Take transport for example: unless you rent a car, you depend on the bus system, which mostly consists of white minibuses which you flag down at a "Bushalte" (or anywhere else really). You then tell them where to go and they drop you off there, but only after they did the same for all the other passengers who were already on that bus. So it takes time, but kinda works like a taxi since they bring you right to your house. At 3 NAf (around Euro 1.30 or USD 1.70) per ride they are rather expensive, especially for the locals, which you'll often just see walking next to the road. Anyway, we got to see a lot of "real" Curacao that way, which is cool, but the whole system is a bit unpredictable and waiting for 40 minutes in the scorching midday heat on a Sunday was rather frustrating. There's a great quote to remember in situations like this though:</p>

<p>â€œThe traveler sees what he sees, the tourist sees what he has come to see." -- G.K. Chesterton</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://moonzroomz.com/">accommodation</a> was rather nice, especially because it's more or less the only backpacker place on the island. It's not in a particularly good location, since it's neither close to the beach nor the town center, but it has a lovely garden, two great dogs, a cute cat and you are bound to meet interesting people here. We were especially lucky with our initial group, since we all got along super well and did all kinds of things together. I found this kinda cool since the youngest member of our gang was 21, while the oldest was 53. This also allowed us to pool our money to rent a car for 3 days, which finally gave us the option to explore some of the nicer beaches in the northwest of the island (Kleine Knip is my favorite, so if you ever make it to Curacao, make sure to check it out). Anyway, you all definitely added a lot to our Curacao experience, so thanks guys!</p>

<p>One thing I really found attractive about Curacao is the mix of languages and cultures. I have a soft spot for creole languages, so I obviously really liked Papiamento. I almost was tempted to attend a course, but I've done enough strange language courses in the past when I got carried away while traveling (Nepali for example). Besides Papiamento there's still a lot of Dutch, many people speak English and there are a fair few Chinese and some South Asians around. It's this hotchpotch of cultures and the fact that Curacao's main industry is not tourism (yet), that make the place rather interesting.</p>

<p>Considering how long this mail already is, it's rather surprising that I haven't talked about one of my favorite topics yet: food! The local cuisine is an interesting mix of various cooking traditions, with Dutch things like Kroket and Bitterballen next to more Caribbean fare like Papaya stew, plantains and obviously loads of seafood . On top of that there are many Chinese takeout places referred to as "Snacks", which serve decent but rather uninspired staples like fried rice and noodles. Compared to many of the other options they are rather cheap though, so they became a regular contributor to our diet. They also serve a lot of vegetarian food, which made my life considerably easier, although I have to say that while the local cuisine is rather meat heavy, people were generally very helpful and considerate and just made up vegetarian dishes on the fly for me, which is more than can be said for a lot of other places. Last but not least there's also quite a few Surinamese restaurants and "roti shops", and although we only got to try one, I have to say we instantly became fans (veggies and roti, what's not to like?).</p>

<p>So, how to sum up our Curacao experience? Overall, it was a pretty good and enjoyable stay. The Caribbean is not Asia, so on a backpacker's budget it may not be easy to have that perfect lazy beach holiday. Especially compared to Thailand or Malaysia, where 15 Euro per day gets me all the luxury I need, meaning a decent room in a nice place and good food. On Curacao the same was closer to 40-45 Euro per day (including the 3 days of shared rental car), which is a bit steep for the kind of journey we are on. But after a rather stressful period in Vienna we both needed to wind down, so this was a bit like a little holiday before the actual trip. Besides that the pleasant weather, perfect sea and beaches and the interesting cultural mix definitely made it a worthwhile stay.</p>

<p>Would I recommend this place? If you are willing to spend a bit, definitely. Compared to neighboring Aruba it's actually pretty cheap, but if you are on a budget, your perspective changes. A car definitely is a worthwhile investment, so if money's tight, try to find people to team up with, even if it's just for a couple of days. Also, if you do wanna spoil yourself, invest in a trip to Klein Curacao! Granted, 75 Euro for a day trip is quite the investment when you are traveling for a long time, but a couple of hours on an uninhabited Caribbean island were definitely worth it in my book.</p>

<p>The next mail will probably be about Paraguay (which is where arrived last Sunday), so stay tuned!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been so long since I last wrote an email too all of you guys, that I really don't know where to start. But even if I knew, it would be an email of epic proportions, which I'd rather leave to Spyro. So how about a quick rundown instead?</p>

<p>*) Nepal: after India, Spyro and I went to Nepal where we stayed for 3 month from early July on. It's a cool place with really nice people and due to rather recent political developments it was quite an interesting time to be there. But the most important thing is that I fell in love there. Although technically I probably fell in love in Turkey already. But then love followed me to Nepal and fell on me. "Love" also has a name, which is Paola. She's Italian, I live in Italy now. There might be a connection. Oh yeah, I also went up to Everest Base Camp (around 17,000 ft) with Spyro and a group of 5 Indians, which was quite nice. It also taught me a very important lesson about myself: I'm a city person and mountains annoy me after a while, even if they are the highest and most beautiful in the world.</p>

<p>*) Bangladesh: the biggest surprise of this trip for me, Bangladesh turned out be a wonderful place, full of surprises and lovely randomness. If you are up for a travel destination that's not overrun by tourists, you should definitely consider this an option. Spy will probably be there longer, so go bother... I mean go and keep him company! Anyway, since it's hard to describe Bangladesh in only a few lines - and I really don't feel like writing many right now - you should go find out yourself. While you are at it, make sure to ride the Volcano in Wonderland (an amusement park) in Dhaka, it's quite a life changing experience. One more thing: our stay in Dhaka would never have been the same without Shipu - the CS host we stayed with - and his wonderful friends who are mostly artists from the Dhaka Fine Arts Academy. Thanks for introducing us to all this wonderful people, taking us to Hindu festivals, arranging to us for be in a movie and so much more. You ARE the jungle king, Shipu!</p>

<p>*) Italy: since October 30th I'm now in Italy, more specifically Milano. I live here, which I can prove by owing a public transport pass. I'm also looking for a job right now, keep your fingers crossed this coming Friday! Isn't it ironic to have a job interview on the 1 year anniversary of my unemployment? Besides that Paola and I are currently looking for a flat and once we got one exclusive invitations for visiting us will be sent out to a select few (read: if you wanna come and crash on the couch, sending an email doesn't hurt, we may be able to put you up).</p>

<p>*) Spain: Before I forget it, I finally made it to Barcelona: Paola and I went there for 9 days end of November/beginning of December. Apparently there's only two groups of people, the ones who love the city and the ones who hate it. If i have to choose between those 2 extremes, I definitely fall more in the first category, we really did enjoy our time there!</p>

<p>That's it for today kids, some of you I'm supposed to see rather soon anyway. All the others probably are aware of the fact that I miss them, even though I can be horrible at staying in touch, answering mails etc. But that's part of why you love me, right?</p>

<p>Hugs and kisses,
M</p>

    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2008/07/06/its-not-where-you-come-from</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>...it's more where you're going [...]. At least according to the "Mighty Mighty Bosstones":http://www.bosstonesmusic.com/, who are usually right. Unfortunately Indians don't seem to agree on this, so Spyro and me have to go through quite a few iterations of "Mister, which country?" every day. Funnily enough nobody seems to really care about the answers, unless they provide a chance to mistake "Austria" for "Australia". Seriously, any more of this and I'm the first to scream "Oi! Oi! Oi!" at the next "Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!" "chant":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aussie_Aussie_Aussie,_Oi_Oi_Oi. Other popular questions include "What's your good name" (I didn't know I have a bad name too, I was told it's called a "reputation") and "What's your profession?" (neither "nothing" nor "bum" seem to be acceptable answers by the way). So after two and a half month of this we became very good at nodding and smiling, ignoring people's requests or outright lying to their questions. In short it's like a boot camp for becoming a politician.</p>

<p>After this small rant - and I'm sparing you the ones on environmental awareness ("everything is bio-degradable if you give it a couple million years") and the ancient Indian martial art commonly known in the West as "traffic" - I want to give you some information about our last destinations: after good old Varkala we made our way to Allepey to do a houseboat tour of the amazing "Kerala backwaters":http://wikitravel.org/en/Kerala_backwaters, where we were amazed to hear that this place in India is one of the world's least polluted areas. Unfortunately people seem to be aware of this irony and are working hard on remedying this confusing state, so make sure to go there soon. Next stop was the "Bamboostix Island Resort":http://www.istay.in/, which is a beautiful and relaxing place. Alas nobody else seems to be aware of this, so we were the only guests at that time which made our stay a bit less interesting than originally hoped for. At least there was a "carrom board":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrom and we could see the start of the monsoon in Kerala at night... Other highlights of our trip were the beautiful tea plantations around "Munnar":http://wikitravel.org/en/Munnar, "Gokarna":http://wikitravel.org/en/Gokarna (hint: climbing/walking around the cliffs during the monsoon is not a smart idea) and all the beautiful climbing/bouldering spots around "Hampi":http://wikitravel.org/en/Hampi. Oh yeah, I kinda forgot to mention "Cochin":http://wikitravel.org/en/Cochin where we had a small but nice CouchSurfing meeting and "Calicut":http://wikitravel.org/en/Calicut, where absolutely nothing remarkable happened (the Bratislava of India so to say :p). The 10 days in "Bombay":http://wikitravel.org/en/Bombay where mostly spent hanging out with old and new friends (Paul, Jo, Blake and Mike), but we also got around to do an absolutely amazing tour of Asia's biggest slum, "Dharavi":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharavi, which I heartily recommend to any Bombay visitor! I also managed to lose some weight there, mainly in the form of my wallet which spontaneously decided to get itself a new owner on a suburban train during the rush-hour (although civil war might be a better description). I only lost 150 rupees and my debit card (which thanks to Kerstin and other nice AUA employees got "delivered" to me in Delhi for free - thanks again!), a fair price for my first pick-pocket victim experience. Right now we are hanging out at Avi's house in Delhi, and despite all the bad things we've heard about the city beforehand, it's surprisingly cool so far. Granted that may have to do with the fact that "pizza man" Mike, Toni "Don't freak, I'm a Sikh" Walia and a couple other cool cats decided to hit the city at the same time, but it's a pleasant surprise nonetheless. Tomorrow noon we (viz. Spy, Claudio from Brazil, Samantha from the States and yours truly) are heading off to Kathmandu, one of my dream destinations ever since I saw "The Golden Child" with Eddie Murphy. I better see some snake charmers there, otherwise I'll be a very very sad camper...</p>

<p>I can't believe my first 2,5 month in India are almost over now, it's definitely been a remarkable trip with a lot of unique memories (animals, strikes, riots, crowds, stares, weird people, weirder people, incredibly nice and hospitable people, you name it). "Incredible India"? Definitely!</p>

<p>Love,
M</p>

<p>P.S. Go watch "Charlie Bartlett":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423977/, it's a great movie. And brush your teeth at least twice a day!</p>

    <id>http://citizen428.net/blog/2008/05/25/how-i-became-relegated-to-being-man-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Time for some random musings on India...</p>

<p>Austr(i|ali)a: Let's face it, nobody knows Austria. It usually goes like this: "Where are you from?" - (Oh no, not again...) Austria." - "Ah, Australia. Good country! Cricket!" - "Uhm, yes. Australia's a good country, but I'm from Austria." - "Yes, Australia. Good!" - But then, only a few days ago, it seems as if the word "Austria" suddenly registers with my conversation partner, he concentrates deeply for a moment, smiles and then asks: "Arnold country?" - There is no god.</p>

<p>Buckets: Indian hotels led to my newfound admiration for buckets, the most useful tool mankind ever invented! Why? Because they are incredibly versatile. You can wash your clothes in them, use them as showers, puke into them, sweep floors with the water inside them, turn them around and use them as chairs or to catch cockroaches, the possibilities are almost endless. In bucket we trust!</p>

<p>Cricket: India is cricket country, full stop. The sport is everywhere, and although I fully agree that aliens must have brought it to our planet (who am I to argue with Douglas Adams?), I lately feel a strange attraction to it, watching quite a bit of the new Indian Twenty20 league together with good old Spyro. In our defense, it is a lot more interesting to watch than test cricket, and - as an Australian guy explained to us yesterday - it's as close to backyard cricket as you can get. Wait, backyard cricket? We're in! Because playing cricket is even more fun than watching it. Especially when you play barefoot with a bunch of Indians on dirty streets, where you are out after one bounce and a boundary doesn't get you 4 or 6 points, but evil looks from everybody around 'cause you just lost the ball...</p>

<p>Transport: Auto-rickshaw - done. Bicycle-rickshaw - done. Non-AC bus for 15+ hours on horrible roads - done. Sitting on the floor in an overcrowded train next to an open door - done. Riding on top of a truck to the amusement of the Indians around us - done.</p>

<p>Movies: Indians are crazy about their cinema. And Indian cinema is crazy. In fact, it's crazy enough to let bums like Spyro and me play business men in a Tamil movie. Yes, business men! We got casted ("You guys wanna be in a movie tomorrow?" - "Hm, why not..." - "Can you maybe shave?" - "No!" - "Ok") in our lovely Mahabalipuram and went to the movie shot in Chennai the next day (and yes, they paid our ride there, which was quite handy since we needed to catch a bus from there anyway), arrived at the set around 9:30, got great food and then...sat around for a while. After a couple of hours we got more great food and were told "Relax over there in the shade". Relax? Sure, we are good at that. Anyway, eventually they made us wear suits (it's good that there are no pics, Spy looked like a 16 year old forced to wear a suit for some relative's wedding or something), and gave us our great lines. Originally I was supposed to be Man#1, who had an impressive 15 words of text ("Okay, Mr. Krishna. We have decided to start three new companies in association with you."), but after we told the producers that we couldn't make it back to Chennai ten days later, the stuttering African guy got promoted and I was relegated to become Man#2 ("You have to make them the best companies!"). Spyro starred as Man#3 ("Not only the best, but also number one!"), but later managed to sneak another sentence in. Overall a very cool experience, the male lead and the other guys were all really nice and funny, we got delicious food and 500 rupees. The movie will start in South Indian cinemas around August 2008, but if things keep going at the current rate, we'll be living in Hollywood by then. I wonder if the food is as good there...</p>

<p>Travels: After the last big update (sent from Bangalore) we went on to Pondicherry (nice, but a bit boring) including a day-trip to Auroville (according to Wikipedia it's an "experimental township", according to us it's...weird), Mahabalipuram (a relaxed backpacker town), Chennai (from here to fame) and Rameswaram (impressing temple, great food and close to an eerie post-Tsunami ghost-town). Last stop in Tamil Nadu was Kanyakumari, where the Arabian Sea meets the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal, and where the food is terrible. Right now we are in Kerala, a state ruled by the first democratically elected communist government in the world. We spent a couple of hours in the state capital Trivandrum, before coming to Varkala (another very backpackery town) where we are currently hanging around like a bad smell (literally). Our future plans are - as always - tentative at best, so if you have any suggestions or want to meet up somewhere, shoot me a message!</p>

<p>Lots of love and licks to body parts of your choice,
M</p>
