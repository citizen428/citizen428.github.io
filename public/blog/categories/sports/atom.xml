    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After my two private lessons last week I had my first full Taekwondo training session today. Here&rsquo;s what I learned: My overall lifestyle and sports don&rsquo;t really mix. Sex, drugs and Rock&#8217;n&#8217;Roll - unfortunately I&rsquo;m doing way better in some categories than in others - definitely took a beating (pun intended) from martial arts. My lungs declared war on me (damn you cheap Chinese cigarettes!), my pulse was going so fast that I was afraid an 8bit counter might not suffice for counting it and various other parts of my body just seemed very surprised to get used again. But once this painful first 15 minutes were over, the following 50 minutes were actually pretty cool and I&rsquo;m looking forward to Thursday&rsquo;s session.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I started my new job this January, I more or less stopped doing any sports, which had the usual consequences of fitness&ndash;&nbsp;&amp;&amp; weight++. I&rsquo;ve wanted to change this for quite a while now and since my local &ldquo;Taekwondo school&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.taekwondo-twin-center.at/home.php?ttc_schule_id=8">http://www.taekwondo-twin-center.at/home.php?ttc_schule_id=8</a> - which by the way is conviniently located half-way between my apartment and the office - currently has a special offer (two private introductory lessons plus the &ldquo;dobok&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobok">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobok</a> for 25 Euro) I decided to give it a go. The first intro lesson today was pretty cool and the second will be this Wednesday. After this I&rsquo;ll get my white belt and will formally start training in the beginner&rsquo;s class.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b>
Had my second private lesson on Wednesday and really liked it too, so I signed up for the school and will try to train 2-3 times a week from now on. Since there are 13(!) training sessions per week I can choose from, I should be able to squeeze them in even in rather busy weeks.</p>
