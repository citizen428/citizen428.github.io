  <div class="entry-content"><p align="center"><img src="http://religionsfreie-zone.de/zone.jpg" alt="Heidenspaß statt Höllenquallen" /></a><br />
<br />
For the last few days the pope&#8217;s visit at the <a href="http://www.wjt2005.de/">Weltjugendtag</a> in Cologne is dominating German speaking media. If you look at how the participants celebrate &#8220;the vicar of Peter&#8221;, you&#8217;d almost believe that The Beatles are on tour again&#8230; I even did see a laola wave on TV! What were this guys chanting while doing this? I suppose something along the lines of &#8220;Give me an I! I! Give me a N! N! &#8230; So what&#8217;s the word? <span class="caps">INQUISITION</span>! Horray!&#8221; would have done the trick. When I saw all this religious hysteria, I nearly got afraid that in some years time secularism will only be a fond memory and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism">creationists</a> will try to take over the European school system&#8230;.  Finally I found a link to this <a href="http://religionsfreie-zone.de/">platform</a> in <a href="http://www.teemow.com/2005/08/20/blessms/">teemow&#8217;s blog</a>, which tells me that I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks that the enlightenment was one of the better episodes in recent human history&#8230;  Or maybe I just haven&#8217;t seen the light, and the pope is here to reinstall Edmund Stoiber as emperor by God&#8217;s grace, after which millions of Germans will do laola waves, singing &#8220;habemus papam&#8221; and &#8220;Wir sind Papst!&#8221;. And in the digital age, Canossa is only an election pledge away&#8230;<br />

<i>Note: I really respect religion and people&#8217;s religious believes, as long as those people in return respect my agnostic and critical approach to religion. Believe in anything you want, be it God, Buddha, Krishna or some stones in the desert. I really couldn&#8217;t care less, but don&#8217;t try to force your believes on me and try to stay in touch with recent (e.g. no older than say, 200 years) scientific developments.</i></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No, this is not about a certain patchset for the kernel sources, so you can get your blood pressure down again. Instead it&#8217;s about &#8220;an efficient, yet simple engine for developing professional Web Applications using the Ruby language&#8221; (quoted from <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/nitro/">Rubyforge</a>).</p>
<p>I know, this sounds a lot like the much hyped <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, but <a href="http://nitrohq.com/">Nitro</a> definitely is diffent! I now could try to sum up the cool features of this framework, but I think some excerpts from the <span class="caps">README</span> can do a better job than me:<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you can see, I&#8217;ve once again changed the template I&#8217;m using for my blog. As I&#8217;ve told you before the Kubrick port was only a temporary solution, but it got on my nerves faster than I expected. There are just too many sites using it&#8230;</p>
<p>I now use a style called &#8220;Blogger-Tabacco&#8221; by <a href="blog.magenson.de">Frédéric Wenzel</a>, which I think looks pretty cool. I&#8217;ve changed the <span class="caps">CSS</span> to better suit my taste though: the image initially was on the left, but I thought this interferes too much with the main content. I therefore put it on the right and switched it horizontally. After this I had to move the header a little, otherwise the top left corner would have been way too empty.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m pretty happy with the new look, although there are still a few more tweaks I want to apply to the stylesheet. I guess this template will stay a little longer than the last one, but who knows what mood I&#8217;m in next week&#8230; ;)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The wonders of <span class="caps">FOSS</span>: jabber4r is a Jabber library for Ruby, which has seen its last release in early March 2004. As the package seemed to have problems with newer (&gt;=1.8.2) versions of Ruby, I refrained from adding it to the tree. Well, at least until today, when my Rubyforge tracker informed me that jabber4r-0.8.0 has just been released. It&#8217;s in <span class="caps">CVS</span> already, so it soon should be available on a mirror near you. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Also new to the tree is <span class="caps">PDF</span>::Writer, a library that allows you to create PDFs from Ruby. Sounds cool? It sure is! Go check out the <a href="http://ruby-pdf.rubyforge.org/pdf-writer/demos/index.html">demos</a> if you don&#8217;t believe me&#8230;</p>
<p>Also some <a href="http://www.leyrer.priv.at/martin/">kind soul</a> informed me that yesterday I posted a wrong link to my Gentoo related ta-da list, so here&#8217;s the correct <span class="caps">URL</span>: <a href="http://citizen428.tadalist.com/lists/public/95952">http://citizen428.tadalist.com/lists/public/95952</a>. I also updated my original post with the correct address.</p>
<p>The last paragraph of this blog goes out to all the Gentoo/FreeBSD developers, especially <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~flameeyes/">Flameeyes</a> who submitted a comment to my last entry: if you need anything added to the <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~citizen428/doc/gentoo-freebsd.html">Gentoo/FreeBSD guide</a>, just send me an email with the desired content and I&#8217;ll update the doc <span class="caps">ASAP</span>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t posted on Planet Gentoo for a rather long time, so before anyone thinks that I&#8217;m <span class="caps">MIA</span> again, I thought I&#8217;d better post a little update.</p>
<p>1. I left the games herd. Nobody there will probably miss me, as I never found the time to do more than adding some small games (try <a href="http://home.kcore.de/~kiza/linux/tornado">Tornado</a>!) and <a href="http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=xgame">games-util/xgame</a> to the tree.</p>
<p>2. I&#8217;m currently trying to clean out the Ruby herd&#8217;s bug list. I&#8217;ve finally added some long overdue packages to the tree and set up Rubyforge monitoring so I won&#8217;t forget about them in the future and will try to poke some people to get some of our other old bugs closed.</p>
<p>3. Over the next few days I&#8217;m going to add <a href="http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/">ruby-gnome2-0.13.0</a> to the tree. It&#8217;s not exactly a fun process, as I&#8217;ve learned when I did the version bump to 0.12.0&#8230; While I&#8217;m at it, I also want to add <a href="http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Gtk%3A%3AMozEmbed">ruby-gtkmozembed</a> and ruby-gtktrayicon, which currently aren&#8217;t a part of the official ruby-gnome2 releases.</p>
<p>4. I created a <a href="http://citizen428.tadalist.com/lists/public/95952">shared ta-da list</a> for my Gentoo work, so everyone can see which packages are next on my list to get added to the tree etc. If you are really interested in being able to edit this list, just send an email to citizen428@g.o so I can add you to the trusted people who are allowed to do just this (<span class="caps">NOTE</span>: this offer only concerns people who have a mail adress ending in @gentoo.org, sorry guys).</p>
<p>5. I&#8217;ve done German longdescriptions for all the category metadata.xml files which got added since I first went on a translation spree (except for sci-*, which were done by Kugelfang).</p>
<p>Last but not least here&#8217;s an old but still good article called <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/content/view/1014/2218/">Extending Vim with Ruby</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Internet: the final frontier. These are the voyages of citizen428. His mission: to explore strange net worlds; to seek out new forms of communication and new communities; to boldly go where no man has gone before.</em></p>
<p>Now what do I want to tell you with this rip-off Star Trek intro? The answer is pretty simple: I just love the Internet! Since my first contact with the medium around 1993/94 when I was around 14 it really fascinated me. Nowadays I&#8217;ve mostly abandoned stuff like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBSes</a> and am more focussed on the <span class="caps">WWW</span>, which more often than not makes me spend more time online than is really good for me. Where this fascination comes from I can&#8217;t really tell, but I supposse it has to do with the enormous possibilities the web has to offer: you can find nearly all the <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">information</a> you want, build <a href="http://www.cargal.org/">online communities</a> or <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">communicate</a> with friends everywhere in the world in real-time. Webzines and blogging have in some cases become a valuable alternative to traditional media and additionally the <span class="caps">WWW</span> has taught quite a lot of people some things about freedom of expression, and how important it is to stand up and fight for your rights. At least that&#8217;s what I want to believe. Now that this intro got a lot longer than I originally intended, let&#8217;s get to the things I really wanted to tackle in this entry.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s summer and lots of people love to go surfing. While some go to Hawaii or Portugal, others will  go to the club house of one of the projects I&#8217;m involved in, to surf the web on one of the two shiny new surf stations. Ok, that probably was the lamest introduction I&#8217;ve ever posted here, so let&#8217;s get it on with the technical stuff, seems like I&#8217;m better at that&#8230;</p>
<p>Things started when <a href="http://www.xn--friedhofstribne-cwb.at/fht/index.jsp">we</a> got donated some old Compaq PCs and decided that they will get used as surf stations for the club house. Being old Pentium IIs in the 200 something MHz Range with 3GB hard disks they surely don&#8217;t make you want to scream in ecstasy, but they aren&#8217;t too shabby either. Unfortunately they don&#8217;t have CD-<span class="caps">ROM</span> drives and their design also doesn&#8217;t really allow for them. <br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to another issue of &#8220;citizen428&#8217;s random tidbits&#8221;!</p>
<p>Some days ago I&#8217;ve watched a really great documentary called <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A//www.skinheadattitude.com/&amp;ei=frv0QsOzIczcQr-YvfAN">Skinhead Attitude</a> by Daniel Schweizer. I especially recommend this movie to all people who merely associate Skinheads with stupid right-wing Boneheads, and know nothing about the history of the movement which already lasts for more than 40 years.</p>
<p><i>Skinhead Attitude outlines 40 years of the skinhead movement, from its origins in Jamaica to its current manifestation in present day Britain. By following Karole, a modern skinhead girl with a traditional and anti-racist attitude, the film powerfully draws a portrait of an often maligned group. Concentrating on the left-wing rather than the usual right-wing extremists who are often so readily associated with skinheads, the film describes the transformation and radicalisation of this subculture of youth. Including interviews and music from Bad Manners, Sham 69 and The Oppressed, Skinhead Attitude is a revealing and comprehensive look at a misinterpreted and misunderstood subculture.</i> (<a href="http://www.leedsfilm.com/2004/liff/film/667">Link</a>).</p>
<p>As Ska music is one of the cornerstones of Skinhead culture, this movie also sports a pretty cool soundtrack and has some nice live sequences of bands like Bad Manners, The Oppressed or <a href="http://www.losfastidios.com/">Los Fastidios</a>.  Finally here&#8217;s some suggested reading for people who want to know more about this fascinating subculture: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinhead">Wikipedia:Skinhead</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska">Wikipedia:Ska</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oi%21">Wikipedia:Oi!</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARP">Wikipedia:<span class="caps">SHARP</span></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Fascist_Action">Wikipedia:Anti-Fascist Action</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1903854229/qid=1123336475/sr=8-3/ref=pd_bbs_sbs_3/103-2685163-0146210?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">No Retreat: The Secret War Between Britain&#8217;s Anti-Fascists and the Far Right</a> (we&#8217;ve met co-author Steve Titzey at this year&#8217;s Mondiali Anti Razzisti in Montecchio).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://wiki.whatthehack.org/index.php/Main_Page">What the Hack</a> is over since Sunday, and I finally feel like writing about this great event, which so far definitely was my personal highlight of this summer. A big &#8220;Thank you!&#8221; goes to everyone who made this event possible, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed these 3 days with interesting lectures, nice people and an overall great atmosphere. Special thanks go to Gentoo user and travel compagnion <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=44722">Red B@ron</a> who regularly lent me his laptop (yep, mine&#8217;s still broken) as well as <a href="http://www.teemow.de/">teemow</a> who told me about quite some cool stuff, including <a href="http://www.plazes.com/">Plazes</a> and who incidentally is also a Gentoo user.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t meet any other Gentoo devs at the event, can it really be that besides me and <a href="http://www.hboeck.de/">Hanno</a> nobody made it to the event? If that&#8217;s really the case it&#8217;s a shame, as <span class="caps">WTH</span> really was a good mixture of interesting technical and social lectures, as well as a good chance to meet nice people. It surely boosted my motivation to work on <span class="caps">FOSS</span> projects (including Gentoo of course) even more, so it definitely was worth the trip for me.</p>
<p>And now for some comments on the talks I&#8217;ve seen:</div>
