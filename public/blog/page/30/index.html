  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every so often you&#8217;ll find what you believed to be your future shattered to pieces on which you cut youself. But this pain is healthy, as it makes your mind clear enough to see through all the layers of artifical bullshit modern society has wrapped around your true feelings. It seems like tears make for excellent magnifying glasses&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Against Me! &#8211; 8 Full Hours Of Sleep</strong><br />
<i>When you sleep,<br />
No one is homeless.<br />
When you sleep,<br />
You can&#8217;t feel the hunger.<br />
When you sleep,<br />
No one is lonely in a dream.<br />
Without classes,<br />
Without nations&#8230;<br />
When you sleep,<br />
She&#8217;s standing there with open arms,<br />
And one night could last forever,<br />
And if you asked her,<br />
She&#8217;d never let go,<br />
And you&#8217;d stay forever&#8230;</p>
<p>And the sun&#8217;s always rising<br />
In the sky somewhere,<br />
And if young hearts should explode<br />
From all the lies they&#8217;ve been told&#8230;</p>
<p>Let the new night bring you peace<br />
And the promise of tomorrow,<br />
Where we can wake to a new beginning.<br />
Tomorrow I&#8217;ll all but have lost their faces;<br />
My friends and family,<br />
Memories of all we had<br />
And the times we should have lived,<br />
And tomorrow America just might fall apart.<br />
Tomorrow, tell me,<br />
Where will you wake up?<br />
Beyond title, beyond these careers and laws,<br />
Something more than borders on a map&#8230;</p>
<p>And the sun&#8217;s always rising in the sky somewhere,<br />
And if young hearts should explode<br />
From all the lies they&#8217;ve been told&#8230;<br />
To live through one night like this,<br />
I would trade it for the silence&#8230;<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since too many of life&#8217;s pleasures are demonized by all the greyfaces out there, I&#8217;ve decided to start a new series called &#8220;In defense of&#8221;, where I&#8217;ll collect quotes, song lyrics, etc. which show them in a different &#8211; and maybe more positive &#8211; way.</p>
<p><i><strong>Kikizo:</strong> So, how many drinks does it take for ideas to stop being feasible, good ideas, and start being just complete nonsense?</p>
<p><strong>Itagaki:</strong> Haha! It&#8217;s hard to say, because I am drinking pretty much full-time. Of course, there are ups and downs, waves, of how I drink in terms of the amount, but it&#8217;s a long period of time. In the last ten years &#8211; not that you asked this question &#8211; I think I had better ideas when I was drinking whisky. When I am drinking shochu, that&#8217;s a conservative drink, so the ideas are not that great. Beer is just like water to me, so it just helps me and everyone else loosen up a little bit, it doesn&#8217;t really contribute to coming up with ideas.</i> (found on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2006/7/4/4522">Ars Technica</a>)</p>

Since I started drinkin&#8217; again <br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>June was pretty busy, so I only managed to blog once. So here&#8217;s a little update of what happened during the past few weeks:</p>
<p><strong>Work:</strong><br />
Still the same old bullsh*t, except that I spent 7 days at a customer&#8217;s site in Upper Austria, where we set up several virtual <a href="http://linux-ha.org/">Heartbeat</a> clusters in <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">VMware Server</a>. Summary: the scenery and people in Upper Austria are pretty nice, VMware is one of the coolest things since the invention of sliced bread and Heartbeat really can be a bitch to set up correctly (no surprises here I guess).</p>
<p><strong>Capitalism:</strong><br />
Got myself a <a href="http://www.viewsonic.com/products/desktopdisplays/lcddisplays/valueseries/va1912wb/">nice widescreen 19&quot; <span class="caps">LCD</span></a>  for my beloved Mac Mini. I also decided that it&#8217;s about time to get a new digital camera, since my old one broke ages ago. I finally settled on an <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0510/05100401oly_sp700.asp">Olympus SP-700</a>, which Amazon sold for a really good price. The camera arrived last Thursday, and from what I&#8217;ve seen so far I&#8217;m really impressed with my new gadget. Today I once again went on a <span class="caps">DVD</span> buying spree and bought <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0209077/">Ken Park</a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0105275/">Romper Stomper</a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0092610/">Bad Taste</a> and the first season of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0141842/">The Sopranos</a>. Next on my list are an external Mac Mini HD like the <a href="http://www.newertech.com/ministack">miniStack</a> and a new notebook. Unfortunately neither the MacBook nor the MacBook Pro does really cut it for me (no 12&quot; version, too heavy, too hot and far too many issues reported by early adopters), so I will probably settle for an <a href="http://www5.pc.ibm.com/de/products.nsf/$wwwPartNumLookup/_UK15LGE?OpenDocument">X60s</a> running Gentoo. I&#8217;d really would have loved to buy a portable Mac, but I&#8217;m not enough of an Apple fanboy to buy a product which doesn&#8217;t really fit my needs&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Books:</strong><br />
If you want to read a really good book by a Cuban author, you definitely should try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786716657/ref=sr_11_1/103-1901030-1131048?ie=UTF8">The Insatiable Spiderman</a> by Pedro Juan GutiÃ©rrez. Next on my list is &quot;Playing the Moldovans at Tennis &quot;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0753152142/qid=1151763922/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-1901030-1131048?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155, which I&#8217;ll start reading tomorrow. I also got myself a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596009410/qid=1151763999/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-1901030-1131048?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">Mac OS X Tiger: Missing Manual</a>, which has shown me some neat tricks although it mainly targets a non-techy audience.</p>
<p><strong>Geek stuff:</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve always been a great fan of tiling window managers like <a href="http://www.modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/">Ion3</a>. However, lately I fell in love with <a href="http://wmii.de/">wmii</a>, which I think is an absolutely amazing WM. I&#8217;m using version 3, which features dynamic window management as known from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_%28text_editor%29">acme</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_operating_system">Oberon</a>. Reading the <a href="http://wmii.de/index.php?page=guide">guide</a> doesn&#8217;t take longer than about 15 minutes, after which I was already able to conviniently work with wmii. So far the experience is really great, and I haven&#8217;t even started using the scripting capapilites <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9P">9P</a> offers&#8230; Additionally using wmii once again made me play around with <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/plan9/">Plan 9</a>, an operating system I&#8217;ve been strangely interested in ever since I first heard about it around 6 years ago. Note to self: spend some time with the <a href="https://lists.cse.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/9fans">9fans</a> at <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/">23C3</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Gentoo:</strong><br />
Another month spent without doing anything Gentoo related. To be completely honest, my Gentoo box has only been started twice since I moved into my new apartment in early March. Given that I&#8217;ll be on holidays for around 10 days in July, you once again shouldn&#8217;t expect too much activity from me&#8230; :( I&#8217;m really thinking about leaving the project, as I&#8217;m currently not doing anything which warrants my developer status. Probably the only alternative to that would be dropping all the ebuilds I&#8217;m currently working on, and to focus solely on <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/">Gentoo-alt</a>, maintaining the Gentoo/FreeBSD and Gentoo/NetBSD docs, while also working on <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/macos/index.xml">Gentoo for Mac OS X</a> (although Fink works really well for me). Input wanted!</p>
<p><strong>Random:</strong><br />
September 19th is International Talk Like A Pirate Day. Yarr!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that I&#8217;m working full-time, I have to cope with only 5 weeks of holiday per year, which isn&#8217;t really much compared to the ~5 month you enjoy as an Austrian student. That&#8217;s why I decided to make the most out of it, and as my boss has already approved all of it, I can present you my holiday schedule for 2006.</p>
<p>Mid-July: Me and some friends will go to the <a href="http://www.mondialiantirazzisti.org/">Mondiali Antirazzisti</a> in Montecchio (Italy) again. What&#8217;s better than camping, beer, cocktails, sun and playing soccer all day? Not much, except maybe for the free concerts and cool parties in the evenings. Maybe we&#8217;ll also spend a day or two at the <a href="http://www.rototomsunsplash.com/">Rototom Sunsplash</a>, but that still remains to be seen.</p>
<p>September: I&#8217;ll spend three weeks in China to visit some friends in Beijing and Shanghai, some of whom I haven&#8217;t seen since my days at Tongji University. Additionally a good friend of mine will also be in China at that time, so we&#8217;re going to meet up in Beijing and crash at my former flat mate&#8217;s place for a while.</p>
<p>End of December: Once again I&#8217;ll spend the time between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s Eve in Berlin to visit the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/wiki/Suggestions#Slogan_.5BWorking_Title.5D">Chaos Communication Congres</a>. Given how great last year&#8217;s congress was (thanks again to the people who went with me, you guys have been great fun!), I&#8217;m really looking forward to this!</p>
<p>@ <a href="http://gnulords.org/~colo/serendipity/">All</a> <a href="http://teemow.com/">the</a> <a href="http://red667.org/">usual</a> <a href="http://berq.net/">suspects</a>: if you want to join me on one of those trips (or all of them for that matter), tell me at the next party or give me a call or send me a mail or a carrier pigeon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As regular reader of this blog, you should already know that the Mac Mini I&#8217;ve ordered a while ago arrived last Saturday. During the time I was <a href="http://citizen428.net/archives/268-Sure,-I-can-wait....html">waiting for the delivery</a> I already read up lots of stuff, so that I could immediately get my hands dirty once my new shiny toy arrives. Here are the first impressions of a new Mac OS X convert after one week.</p>
<p>Personally I think that the designers of OS X can&#8217;t be praised high enough. Sure, Aqua may not be everyone&#8217;s taste, but <span class="caps">IMHO</span> it&#8217;s quite nice looking and the usability is absolutely fantastic. All things you want to do work in a simple and intuitive manner without bothering you. Add stuff like <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/">Expose</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Dashboard</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a> and you&#8217;ll understand why the system is such a pleasure to work with. And that doesn&#8217;t even take into account the power that comes with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/">AppleScript</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/">Automator</a> and the available Bash shell.</p>
<p>However, where there&#8217;s light, there&#8217;s shadow. As a long-time user of various Linux distributions, I have come to appreciate the merits of centralized software repositories, where a single command like &#8220;emerge foo&#8221; or &#8220;apt-get install foo&#8221; will get me the app I want without me going to a website and downloading stuff. Now also consider the value of easy upgrades of all installed software components, and it&#8217;s obvious why a good repo is the heart of any self-respecting Linux distro. That&#8217;s something I sometimes thouroughly miss, although Mac OS X doesn&#8217;t fare to bad in this department either: Mac Update keeps the core system up to date, while most decent applications have a way to automatically upate themselfs to the newest available version. Besides that the disk images OS X apps are often distributed as are a really convenient way to try out a program before finally moving it to the &#8220;Applications&#8221; folder. Oh well, you can&#8217;t have everything I guess&#8230;</p>
<p>With Mac OS X comes the possibility to use a plethora of free (as in beer and/or speech) or commercial programs, which as far as I have seen are all of fairly high quality and do a good job of integrating with the user experience of the whole system. Now that I&#8217;ve wet your appetite, you may be quite disappointed to find out that I won&#8217;t talk about this topic right now, but will reserve this for a later blog entry. What can I say, life&#8217;s a bitch&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My Mac Mini is almost here! &#8220;Almost?&#8221;, I hear you asking? Yep, almost, because this morning when the nice lady from the logistics company who is delivering my shiny new toy called, the dialog went something like this.</p>
<p><i><br />
Me: Hello?<br />
Ms. Logistics: Hi, it&#8217;s Ms. Logistics from Foobar Logistics. I have a delivery from Apple for you!<br />
Me (silently): Finally we can take over the world, Igor. <br />
Ms. Logistic: We want to deliver it today, when will you be home?<br />
Me: Well, right after work, 6:30pm, 7:00pm to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>(That&#8217;s where Ms. Logistics showed me how good she is in producing awkward silences.)</p>
<p>Me: Lemme guess, that&#8217;s too late?<br />
Ms. Logistics: Unfortunately, yes. How about tomorrow morning?<br />
Me: Sure, morning&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll be home until about 8:45am.<br />
Ms. Logistics: Uh..ahm..<br />
Me: That&#8217;s too early then?<br />
Ms. Logistics: Yeah, I can&#8217;t promise a delivery that early [sic!]&#8230;  How about 10:00 to 10:30am.<br />
Me: Sure, who needs to go to work anyway? How about the weekend?<br />
Ms. Logistics: I&#8217;m afraid we don&#8217;t deliver on weekends&#8230;<br />
Me: Arrrghhhhhhhhhh!<br />
(Disclaimer: Wording changed for emphasis.)<br />
</i></p>
<p>Finally we agreed on a delivery on Friday afternoon, where at least my girlfriend will be home because she works for a company which &#8211; strangely enough &#8211; believes that Austrian laws regarding maxium work hours per week are to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>And the morale of the story? Try to work for a logistics company, where you&#8217;ll have immense amounts of free time, because they apparently only deliver between 10:37am and 4:23pm on even numbered days&#8230; Seriously, I&#8217;m the last person to expect anyone to work 24/7, but those times Ms. Logistics offered me just don&#8217;t work for anyone who has a regular day job.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Get rid of the day job before ordering the MacBook! ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today when my girlfriend tried to log in to one of her favourite sites to download some music she paid for, her login credentials didn&#8217;t work. When she wrote an email to the support team (after automatic retrieval of the login credentials and checking them for correctness of course), she received the following answer:</p>
<p><i><br />
Hey Silvia, many systems cannot recognize symbols in passwords. Â We have updated your profile and removed the symbol from your password Â so you should be able to successfully login to your account now.  Your new password is [snipped]<br />
[insert company name] Support<br />
</i></p>
<p>What do we learn from this?</p>
<p>1. They want to make us believe &#8220;+&#8221; is a symbol many systems can&#8217;t recognize. Sure. Besides thanks for assuming we&#8217;re too stupid to try out special characters (aka &#8220;symbols&#8221;) in the user name field after several failed log in attempts.<br />
2. They store their customer&#8217;s passwords in cleartext.<br />
3. They change user profiles without permission to avoid looking for the real problem.<br />
4. They even try to make it look like a good solution (&#8220;you should be able to succesfully login to your account now&#8221;).<br />
5. They suck like most tech supports do.</p>
<p>When I read replies like that, I really wonder how people would treat a mechanic who says &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the problem with your engine is, but many streets don&#8217;t recognize your tires so I&#8217;ve changed them. Besides that I changed your ignition lock and made a backup key for myself. All cool, eh?&#8221;.</p>
<p>My only hope: those guys obviously are dull boys, and dull boys don&#8217;t get chicks. If we&#8217;re just a little lucky, the gene pool will sort itself out.</p>
<p>P.S. Yeah, I might be a little p*ssed after spending 13 hours in the office.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not too long ago, Edward Kenworthy <a href="http://ruby-talk.org/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/179515">inquired about &#8217;Ruby&#8217;s lisp features&#8217;</a> on ruby-talk. <a href="http://ruby-talk.org/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/179642">Matz&#8217; answer</a> was as follows:</p>
<p><i>Ruby is a language designed in the following steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>take a simple lisp language (like one prior to CL).</li>
	<li>remove macros, s-expression.</li>
	<li>add simple object system (much simpler than <span class="caps">CLOS</span>).</li>
	<li>add blocks, inspired by higher order functions.</li>
	<li>add methods found in Smalltalk.</li>
	<li>add functionality found in Perl (in OO way).<br />
So, Ruby was a Lisp originally, in theory.<br />
Let&#8217;s call it MatzLisp from now on. ;-)</i><br />
Is it just me, or does that really sound like &#8220;I took a Lisp dialect, removed most of the cool stuff and added some things from other languages&#8221;? Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still think Matz has done a really amazing job when he created Ruby, and it still is one of my favourite programming languages. I just find it amazing how Lisp doesn&#8217;t have more exposure, when apparently some of the &#8220;cool&#8221; languages of today are trying hard to incorporate some of its (less powerful) features.<br /><br /></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m really interested to get some opinions on this particular topic: is there a conncection between how people perceive their own knowledge of computers and what kind of hardware they buy?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering because I&#8217;ve just been reading a discussion about the new Intel based notebooks, especially the new Mac Books which will be released in June. With 13,3&quot; it will be the smallest of Apple&#8217;s new offerings, and a lot of people have cried loud for a MacBook Pro &#8211; ok, the name really sounds stupid &#8211; with the same form factor. But will they really feel a difference? Or do they just want them because the &#8220;Pro&#8221; makes them feel better (no insult intended)? My own hardware almost always has been pretty old, and I have never much felt the need to own something better just because I&#8217;m a &#8220;power user&#8221; (periods of &#8220;decadence kills depression&#8221; excluded of course ;) ). And what&#8217;s a power user anyway?</p>
<p>When my last notebook broke, I ressurected my old desktop machine (an Athlon 650 with 320MB <span class="caps">RAM</span>). Although not blazingly fast, I was able to do everything I wanted. My computing needs may be really simple, but given that I was able to read my mails, surf the web and working/coding in several terminal windows while listening to my MP3s or web radio, why should I bother buying new hardware? The same goes for the Mac Mini which will hopefully get delivered next week: why pay a lot more money for a Core Duo, when the Core Solo is already way better than the machine I had before that and which did everything I wanted? With all the money I have already saved by not buying computers I won&#8217;t really use to their full potential anyway, I can easily buy complete new systems when I don&#8217;t want to upgrade the current ones anymore&#8230;</p>
<p>How about you guys out there? Do you buy fancy new hardware because it makes you feel &#8220;1337&#8221;? Or are you still using your 486 because as a real hacker you know how to squeeze out every percent of performance possible?</p>
