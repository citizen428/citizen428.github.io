  <div class="entry-content"><p>As we all know, football is one of the greatest hobbies around! What&#8217;s better than travelling through the whole country &#8211; and sometimes even further &#8211; with your friends, watching games and having a few beers? Or meeting with people to watch a game on TV together? Or travelling to fan tournaments and playing yourself? Not much, that&#8217;s for sure! :)</p>
<p>Alas there is this dark time called off-season, where you have to find another way to satisfy your football addiction. That&#8217;s exactly the time of the year football books have been written for, and in this blog I&#8217;m going to recommend you three of them.</div>

Ok, they are not really first impressions, as I&#8217;ve played with the framework before.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to <a href="http://gentoo.neysx.org/">Xavier Neys</a>, the Gentoo/FreeBSD doc has made it&#8217;s way into Gentoo&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-freebsd.xml">official documentation</a>. To celebrate this occasion there have been a few little updates and corrections, enjoy! :)</p>
<p>Additionally I&#8217;ve also done an <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~citizen428/doc/gentoo-netbsd.html">installation guide for Gentoo/NetBSD</a> this afternoon. Note that this is <strong><span class="caps">NOT</span></strong> an official Gentoo project though! Instead all the work so far was done by only one person: #gentoo-bsd regular <a href="mailto:thunder@gentoo.pl">Damian Florczyk</a> aka &#8220;thunder&#8221;, who keeps track of this effort in his personal <a href="http://thunder.netbsd.edu.pl/">blog</a>. If you&#8217;re interested in this project feel free to contact Damian to see how you can help!</p>
<p>Last but not least today saw the release of a new <a href="http://nitrohq.com/">Nitro</a> version! As I was just checking my mail when the release announcement came, I immediately started working and had bumped ebuilds for glue, og and nitro (including two new ebuilds for new deps) ready less than an hour later. Unfortunately there seems to be a packaging bug in one of the deps (filenames get all messed up, so require can&#8217;t find them), so this stuff is not commited yet. I&#8217;ve reported this bug upstream and hope this gets fixed fast, so nitro-0.23.0 can find its way into Portage soon. :)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week I not only had time to finally install Gentoo/FreeBSD on one of my machines again, I also  completed the long overdue update of the <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~citizen428/doc/gentoo-freebsd.html">related documentation</a>. What bothers me a little is that the pre-tags (and the comments inside them) look a little odd, but maybe the guide.xsl I use is just too old (I used the one from swift&#8217;s webspace mentioned in <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gdp/doc/doc-tipsntricks.xml">this doc</a>)&#8230; However, the long term goal is to finally make this document conform to the documentation team&#8217;s coding style and make this an official doc, and I guess these problems will go away then.</p>
<p>On a somewhat unrelated note I recently bought a copy of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/monoadn/">Mono: A Developer&#8217;s Notebook</a>. I really like this book, and working through it is a lot of fun, I&#8217;d just wish I had a little more time for it!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, today my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596007922/qid=1124917941/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4699908-2098445?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Mono: A Developer&#8217;s Notebook</a> finally arrived! I ordered this book because I&#8217;m a fan of <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a> pretty much since I&#8217;ve first heard about it, and examples like this <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~edasque/projects/Tutorial/glade2.html">tutorial on writing a web browser</a> show that the framework is quite capable. Additionally there are all this cool new <span class="caps">GNOME</span> apps like Blam!, Beagle, f-spot, Tomboy etc., that demonstrate the possibilites of Mono.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I ordered this book that has gotten pretty good reviews everywhere and which was modelled after the important <span class="caps">FOSS</span> mantra &#8220;Show me the code!&#8221;. Instead of long-winded syntactical explanations, the author uses lots of annotated examples to get his point across. I hope that this weekend I&#8217;ll have some free time to get started with reading&#8230;. :)</p>
<p>A last note: it&#8217;s incredibly cool that Amazon gives you the possibility to buy books from alternative   dealers via their site! I can go to Amazon, look for the books I&#8217;m interested in, read the reviews etc. and then compare if it may be cheaper to buy this book somewhere else. And if it really is, I can still buy the book as if I would have bought it from Amazon. But guess what? Of all the books I&#8217;ve ordered there, only 2 so far were from alternative dealers, because most of the time the extra shipment costs make the book more expensive than the ad itself makes you believe. But for the &#8220;Developer&#8217;s Notebook&#8221; it really made sense to buy it from <a href="http://caiman.com/">Caiman</a>, because it was not only cheaper, I also got the book after 7 days (from Florida!) compared to 10 to 13 days Amazon.de states as delivery time for this article.</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;m tired. My English probably sucks because of that. Live with it.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As most of us know, MS Word isn&#8217;t really suited for long and complex documents. I&#8217;ve heard things got better with recent releases, but judging from the experiences of others, it still pretty much sucks in some respects&#8230;</p>
<p>Now that I will soon start with my diploma thesis, I obviously spent some time thinking about the tool I will use to write it. As all my current machines only run <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> or some flavor of <a href="http://www.bsd.org/"><span class="caps">BSD</span></a>, Word was definitely not an option (it never really was one anway). After some considertation, I came to the conclusion that this is the perfect opportunity to finally teach myself some <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. I&#8217;ve done some research already and found useful stuff like <a href="http://www.komascript.de/"><span class="caps">KOMA</span>-Script</a>. Now one big question remains: which editor/<span class="caps">IDE</span> shall be used? Here are the contestants:<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, I&#8217;ve done it again. Another redesign. Guilty as charged. This is the forth layout since I started this blog and the third in the last 3 weeks. Here&#8217;s a little recap of all the designs:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>MT &#8211; Trendy</strong>: A nice design by Sebastian Bergmann, but after a while it just got on my nerves too much and I can&#8217;t even say why.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Kubrick 1.2.6 port</strong>: After I got tired of my initial layout, I switched over to the Kubrick port done by Tom Sommer. I still think that Kubrick actually is a rather nice layout, but so do lots of other people, which is the reason you can see this theme everywhere&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Blogger-Tabacco</strong>: Done by Frédéric Wenzel, I tweaked the <span class="caps">CSS</span> a little to get the background image to the right and was pretty happy with the look. But after a really short period I realized that although I liked the colors and all, the design wasn&#8217;t &#8220;me&#8221; somehow&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The current design</strong>: initially based on the template &#8220;Joshua&#8221; by Hendrik Scholz, I&#8217;ve changed the <span class="caps">CSS</span> quite a lot already. Not only did I create my own banner graphic using <a href="http://fyre.navi.cx/">Fyre</a>, I also tweaked the colors to my liking and completely redid the sidebar as I didn&#8217;t like the one &#8220;Joshua&#8221; had to offer. There will be some more minor adjustments to the <span class="caps">CSS</span>, but otherwise, this is it, the new look of citizen428.net!</li>
</ul>
<p>Please post any comments, desing proposals etc. that you might have as a comment, thanks!</p></div>
