  <div class="entry-content"><p>June was pretty busy, so I only managed to blog once. So here&#8217;s a little update of what happened during the past few weeks:</p>
<p><strong>Work:</strong><br />
Still the same old bullsh*t, except that I spent 7 days at a customer&#8217;s site in Upper Austria, where we set up several virtual <a href="http://linux-ha.org/">Heartbeat</a> clusters in <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">VMware Server</a>. Summary: the scenery and people in Upper Austria are pretty nice, VMware is one of the coolest things since the invention of sliced bread and Heartbeat really can be a bitch to set up correctly (no surprises here I guess).</p>
<p><strong>Capitalism:</strong><br />
Got myself a <a href="http://www.viewsonic.com/products/desktopdisplays/lcddisplays/valueseries/va1912wb/">nice widescreen 19&quot; <span class="caps">LCD</span></a>  for my beloved Mac Mini. I also decided that it&#8217;s about time to get a new digital camera, since my old one broke ages ago. I finally settled on an <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0510/05100401oly_sp700.asp">Olympus SP-700</a>, which Amazon sold for a really good price. The camera arrived last Thursday, and from what I&#8217;ve seen so far I&#8217;m really impressed with my new gadget. Today I once again went on a <span class="caps">DVD</span> buying spree and bought <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0209077/">Ken Park</a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0105275/">Romper Stomper</a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0092610/">Bad Taste</a> and the first season of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0141842/">The Sopranos</a>. Next on my list are an external Mac Mini HD like the <a href="http://www.newertech.com/ministack">miniStack</a> and a new notebook. Unfortunately neither the MacBook nor the MacBook Pro does really cut it for me (no 12&quot; version, too heavy, too hot and far too many issues reported by early adopters), so I will probably settle for an <a href="http://www5.pc.ibm.com/de/products.nsf/$wwwPartNumLookup/_UK15LGE?OpenDocument">X60s</a> running Gentoo. I&#8217;d really would have loved to buy a portable Mac, but I&#8217;m not enough of an Apple fanboy to buy a product which doesn&#8217;t really fit my needs&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Books:</strong><br />
If you want to read a really good book by a Cuban author, you definitely should try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786716657/ref=sr_11_1/103-1901030-1131048?ie=UTF8">The Insatiable Spiderman</a> by Pedro Juan GutiÃ©rrez. Next on my list is &quot;Playing the Moldovans at Tennis &quot;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0753152142/qid=1151763922/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-1901030-1131048?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155, which I&#8217;ll start reading tomorrow. I also got myself a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596009410/qid=1151763999/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-1901030-1131048?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">Mac OS X Tiger: Missing Manual</a>, which has shown me some neat tricks although it mainly targets a non-techy audience.</p>
<p><strong>Geek stuff:</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve always been a great fan of tiling window managers like <a href="http://www.modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/">Ion3</a>. However, lately I fell in love with <a href="http://wmii.de/">wmii</a>, which I think is an absolutely amazing WM. I&#8217;m using version 3, which features dynamic window management as known from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_%28text_editor%29">acme</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_operating_system">Oberon</a>. Reading the <a href="http://wmii.de/index.php?page=guide">guide</a> doesn&#8217;t take longer than about 15 minutes, after which I was already able to conviniently work with wmii. So far the experience is really great, and I haven&#8217;t even started using the scripting capapilites <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9P">9P</a> offers&#8230; Additionally using wmii once again made me play around with <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/plan9/">Plan 9</a>, an operating system I&#8217;ve been strangely interested in ever since I first heard about it around 6 years ago. Note to self: spend some time with the <a href="https://lists.cse.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/9fans">9fans</a> at <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/">23C3</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Gentoo:</strong><br />
Another month spent without doing anything Gentoo related. To be completely honest, my Gentoo box has only been started twice since I moved into my new apartment in early March. Given that I&#8217;ll be on holidays for around 10 days in July, you once again shouldn&#8217;t expect too much activity from me&#8230; :( I&#8217;m really thinking about leaving the project, as I&#8217;m currently not doing anything which warrants my developer status. Probably the only alternative to that would be dropping all the ebuilds I&#8217;m currently working on, and to focus solely on <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/">Gentoo-alt</a>, maintaining the Gentoo/FreeBSD and Gentoo/NetBSD docs, while also working on <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/macos/index.xml">Gentoo for Mac OS X</a> (although Fink works really well for me). Input wanted!</p>
<p><strong>Random:</strong><br />
September 19th is International Talk Like A Pirate Day. Yarr!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that I&#8217;m working full-time, I have to cope with only 5 weeks of holiday per year, which isn&#8217;t really much compared to the ~5 month you enjoy as an Austrian student. That&#8217;s why I decided to make the most out of it, and as my boss has already approved all of it, I can present you my holiday schedule for 2006.</p>
<p>Mid-July: Me and some friends will go to the <a href="http://www.mondialiantirazzisti.org/">Mondiali Antirazzisti</a> in Montecchio (Italy) again. What&#8217;s better than camping, beer, cocktails, sun and playing soccer all day? Not much, except maybe for the free concerts and cool parties in the evenings. Maybe we&#8217;ll also spend a day or two at the <a href="http://www.rototomsunsplash.com/">Rototom Sunsplash</a>, but that still remains to be seen.</p>
<p>September: I&#8217;ll spend three weeks in China to visit some friends in Beijing and Shanghai, some of whom I haven&#8217;t seen since my days at Tongji University. Additionally a good friend of mine will also be in China at that time, so we&#8217;re going to meet up in Beijing and crash at my former flat mate&#8217;s place for a while.</p>
<p>End of December: Once again I&#8217;ll spend the time between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s Eve in Berlin to visit the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/wiki/Suggestions#Slogan_.5BWorking_Title.5D">Chaos Communication Congres</a>. Given how great last year&#8217;s congress was (thanks again to the people who went with me, you guys have been great fun!), I&#8217;m really looking forward to this!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As regular reader of this blog, you should already know that the Mac Mini I&#8217;ve ordered a while ago arrived last Saturday. During the time I was <a href="http://citizen428.net/archives/268-Sure,-I-can-wait....html">waiting for the delivery</a> I already read up lots of stuff, so that I could immediately get my hands dirty once my new shiny toy arrives. Here are the first impressions of a new Mac OS X convert after one week.</p>
<p>Personally I think that the designers of OS X can&#8217;t be praised high enough. Sure, Aqua may not be everyone&#8217;s taste, but <span class="caps">IMHO</span> it&#8217;s quite nice looking and the usability is absolutely fantastic. All things you want to do work in a simple and intuitive manner without bothering you. Add stuff like <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/">Expose</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Dashboard</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a> and you&#8217;ll understand why the system is such a pleasure to work with. And that doesn&#8217;t even take into account the power that comes with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/">AppleScript</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/">Automator</a> and the available Bash shell.</p>
<p>However, where there&#8217;s light, there&#8217;s shadow. As a long-time user of various Linux distributions, I have come to appreciate the merits of centralized software repositories, where a single command like &#8220;emerge foo&#8221; or &#8220;apt-get install foo&#8221; will get me the app I want without me going to a website and downloading stuff. Now also consider the value of easy upgrades of all installed software components, and it&#8217;s obvious why a good repo is the heart of any self-respecting Linux distro. That&#8217;s something I sometimes thouroughly miss, although Mac OS X doesn&#8217;t fare to bad in this department either: Mac Update keeps the core system up to date, while most decent applications have a way to automatically upate themselfs to the newest available version. Besides that the disk images OS X apps are often distributed as are a really convenient way to try out a program before finally moving it to the &#8220;Applications&#8221; folder. Oh well, you can&#8217;t have everything I guess&#8230;</p>
<p>With Mac OS X comes the possibility to use a plethora of free (as in beer and/or speech) or commercial programs, which as far as I have seen are all of fairly high quality and do a good job of integrating with the user experience of the whole system. Now that I&#8217;ve wet your appetite, you may be quite disappointed to find out that I won&#8217;t talk about this topic right now, but will reserve this for a later blog entry. What can I say, life&#8217;s a bitch&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My Mac Mini is almost here! &#8220;Almost?&#8221;, I hear you asking? Yep, almost, because this morning when the nice lady from the logistics company who is delivering my shiny new toy called, the dialog went something like this.</p>
<p><i><br />
Me: Hello?<br />
Ms. Logistics: Hi, it&#8217;s Ms. Logistics from Foobar Logistics. I have a delivery from Apple for you!<br />
Me (silently): Finally we can take over the world, Igor. <br />
Ms. Logistic: We want to deliver it today, when will you be home?<br />
Me: Well, right after work, 6:30pm, 7:00pm to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>(That&#8217;s where Ms. Logistics showed me how good she is in producing awkward silences.)</p>
<p>Me: Lemme guess, that&#8217;s too late?<br />
Ms. Logistics: Unfortunately, yes. How about tomorrow morning?<br />
Me: Sure, morning&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll be home until about 8:45am.<br />
Ms. Logistics: Uh..ahm..<br />
Me: That&#8217;s too early then?<br />
Ms. Logistics: Yeah, I can&#8217;t promise a delivery that early [sic!]&#8230;  How about 10:00 to 10:30am.<br />
Me: Sure, who needs to go to work anyway? How about the weekend?<br />
Ms. Logistics: I&#8217;m afraid we don&#8217;t deliver on weekends&#8230;<br />
Me: Arrrghhhhhhhhhh!<br />
(Disclaimer: Wording changed for emphasis.)<br />
</i></p>
<p>Finally we agreed on a delivery on Friday afternoon, where at least my girlfriend will be home because she works for a company which &#8211; strangely enough &#8211; believes that Austrian laws regarding maxium work hours per week are to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>And the morale of the story? Try to work for a logistics company, where you&#8217;ll have immense amounts of free time, because they apparently only deliver between 10:37am and 4:23pm on even numbered days&#8230; Seriously, I&#8217;m the last person to expect anyone to work 24/7, but those times Ms. Logistics offered me just don&#8217;t work for anyone who has a regular day job.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Get rid of the day job before ordering the MacBook! ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today when my girlfriend tried to log in to one of her favourite sites to download some music she paid for, her login credentials didn&#8217;t work. When she wrote an email to the support team (after automatic retrieval of the login credentials and checking them for correctness of course), she received the following answer:</p>
<p><i><br />
Hey Silvia, many systems cannot recognize symbols in passwords. Â We have updated your profile and removed the symbol from your password Â so you should be able to successfully login to your account now.  Your new password is [snipped]<br />
[insert company name] Support<br />
</i></p>
<p>What do we learn from this?</p>
<p>1. They want to make us believe &#8220;+&#8221; is a symbol many systems can&#8217;t recognize. Sure. Besides thanks for assuming we&#8217;re too stupid to try out special characters (aka &#8220;symbols&#8221;) in the user name field after several failed log in attempts.<br />
2. They store their customer&#8217;s passwords in cleartext.<br />
3. They change user profiles without permission to avoid looking for the real problem.<br />
4. They even try to make it look like a good solution (&#8220;you should be able to succesfully login to your account now&#8221;).<br />
5. They suck like most tech supports do.</p>
<p>When I read replies like that, I really wonder how people would treat a mechanic who says &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the problem with your engine is, but many streets don&#8217;t recognize your tires so I&#8217;ve changed them. Besides that I changed your ignition lock and made a backup key for myself. All cool, eh?&#8221;.</p>
<p>My only hope: those guys obviously are dull boys, and dull boys don&#8217;t get chicks. If we&#8217;re just a little lucky, the gene pool will sort itself out.</p>
<p>P.S. Yeah, I might be a little p*ssed after spending 13 hours in the office.</p>

	<li>remove macros, s-expression.</li>
	<li>add simple object system (much simpler than <span class="caps">CLOS</span>).</li>
	<li>add blocks, inspired by higher order functions.</li>
	<li>add methods found in Smalltalk.</li>
	<li>add functionality found in Perl (in OO way).<br />
So, Ruby was a Lisp originally, in theory.<br />
Let&#8217;s call it MatzLisp from now on. ;-)</i><br />
Is it just me, or does that really sound like &#8220;I took a Lisp dialect, removed most of the cool stuff and added some things from other languages&#8221;? Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still think Matz has done a really amazing job when he created Ruby, and it still is one of my favourite programming languages. I just find it amazing how Lisp doesn&#8217;t have more exposure, when apparently some of the &#8220;cool&#8221; languages of today are trying hard to incorporate some of its (less powerful) features.<br /><br /></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m really interested to get some opinions on this particular topic: is there a conncection between how people perceive their own knowledge of computers and what kind of hardware they buy?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering because I&#8217;ve just been reading a discussion about the new Intel based notebooks, especially the new Mac Books which will be released in June. With 13,3&quot; it will be the smallest of Apple&#8217;s new offerings, and a lot of people have cried loud for a MacBook Pro &#8211; ok, the name really sounds stupid &#8211; with the same form factor. But will they really feel a difference? Or do they just want them because the &#8220;Pro&#8221; makes them feel better (no insult intended)? My own hardware almost always has been pretty old, and I have never much felt the need to own something better just because I&#8217;m a &#8220;power user&#8221; (periods of &#8220;decadence kills depression&#8221; excluded of course ;) ). And what&#8217;s a power user anyway?</p>
<p>When my last notebook broke, I ressurected my old desktop machine (an Athlon 650 with 320MB <span class="caps">RAM</span>). Although not blazingly fast, I was able to do everything I wanted. My computing needs may be really simple, but given that I was able to read my mails, surf the web and working/coding in several terminal windows while listening to my MP3s or web radio, why should I bother buying new hardware? The same goes for the Mac Mini which will hopefully get delivered next week: why pay a lot more money for a Core Duo, when the Core Solo is already way better than the machine I had before that and which did everything I wanted? With all the money I have already saved by not buying computers I won&#8217;t really use to their full potential anyway, I can easily buy complete new systems when I don&#8217;t want to upgrade the current ones anymore&#8230;</p>
<p>How about you guys out there? Do you buy fancy new hardware because it makes you feel &#8220;1337&#8221;? Or are you still using your 486 because as a real hacker you know how to squeeze out every percent of performance possible?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_%28psychology%29">burned out</a>. For good. I&#8217;m totally done. I&#8217;m dragging myself to work, trying to kill time and getting home before I manage to screw something up (again). I&#8217;m more cynical and bad-tempered than ever, which I guess is pretty hard for the people around me.</p>
<p>How about the other IT workers out there? Do you feel the same? And do you have any tips on how to get out of this?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, I often dream really strange dreams. But last night&#8217;s was an exceptionally funky one, which was also of the vivid kind which always leaves you pretty confused after waking up&#8230; It was set in an end of the world scenario which made the setting of Philip K. Dick&#8217;s &#8220;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&#8221; seem like a Disney theme park. There only was a small group of people &#8211; including me &#8211; left, who knew perfectly well that they were the last human beings on a dying planet. It was interesting how people coped with this knowledge, with emotions like anger, resignation and panic switching as often and rapidly as the sheets in a cheap bordello. But when finally everybody realized that there definitely was no food left on Earth (hey, who said dreams have to be realistic), nobody panicked anymore, but instead showed a strange kind of relief&#8230; And the morale of the story? If you&#8217;re interested in the movie rights, contact me before I completely forget everything.</p>
