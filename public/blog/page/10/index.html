  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week <a href="http://mrjaba.posterous.com/">Tom</a> &mdash; who is now a happily married man :-) &mdash; and yours truly finally read another paper and since I&#8217;m sick and barely left bed for the last 2 days I decided to fight my boredom by writing about it.</p>
<p><strong>The paper</strong><br />
&#8220;Multiple Aspect Ranking using the Good Grief Algorithm&#8221; by Benjamin Snyder and Regina Barzilay from the <span class="caps">MIT</span> CS and AI Lab.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/regina/my_papers/ggranker.ps">Paper</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bsnyder/presentations/naacl07.pdf">Presentation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/bsnyder/naacl07/">Data and code</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
The paper is in the field of sentiment analysis &mdash; extracting opinions from a text &mdash; and uses restaurant reviews as a corpus. The prime assumption is that such texts will contain more than one opinion (e.g. quality of food, price range, interior, quality of service), which the authors believe is not properly reflected by previous work in this area, where one opinion per text is assumed.</p>
<p>The problem the authors try to solve is assigning a rank from a fixed scale (e.g. 1-5) to several related aspects. They dismiss the easy approach of treating every aspect as a separate ranking problem, since they believe that a real text relates the different aspects in a coherent way (e.g. through phrases like &#8220;but&#8221;, &#8220;one problem was&#8221; etc.).</p>
<p>They built on previous work in the natural language processing field, namely linear models trained with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron">&#8220;Perceptron&#8221;</a> and extended this framework with a sort of &#8220;meta-model&#8221; that predicts relations (agreement or disagreement) between the individually ranked aspects. By relating the different aspects in such a way, it&#8217;s easier to reflect the contrasting views in real text like &#8220;good <span class="caps">BUT</span> pricey&#8221; in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>What follows is some math, where each input (a review) gets assigned an m-dimensional ranking vector (reflecting m aspects). For example if you try to rank 3 different aspects (food, service, price) on a scale of 1-5 a ranking vector might look like &lt;5,5,3&gt; (&#8220;food and service were great, but it was a bit pricey&#8221;). The joint ranking model then combines the individual ranks with an &#8220;agreement model&#8221; to introduce &#8220;grief terms&#8221; which express dissatisfaction in a certain aspect. The algorithm than tries to minimize the sum of this &#8220;grief&#8221; &mdash; which is what gave the algorithm its name &mdash; in a joint rank. This step then gets incorporated into the training of the individual rankers (there&#8217;s some pseudo-code for the joint training), where features of an aspect get represented through presence or absence of words and word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram">bigrams</a>. This is obviously a very simplified description of the algorithm, but it seems moot to repeat the entire math here, which is very well laid out in the presentation. There&#8217;s also a very nice illustration about decoding and relating the various aspects at the end of the <span class="caps">PDF</span>.</p>
<p>What then follows is a comparison of the Good Grief algorithm with similar algorithms on a corpus of 4500 restaurant reviews ranking restaurants on 5 different aspects, where it outperforms the &#8220;competition&#8221; in a statistically relevant way.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong><br />
As someone who works in an area where sentiment analyses could come in handy I do have an interest in the topic, but alas we don&#8217;t have the time and resources to develop our own system to do this properly. I once hacked something together with JRuby and the OpenNLP library, which wasn&#8217;t really sentiment analysis but an attempt to extract useful phrases from reviews. It was crude and had its faults, but worked surprisingly well for the amount of time it took to write. It did however get abandoned in a prototype stage and after reading the paper it&#8217;s quite clear to me that that probably was a good choice. Sentiment analysis is a non-trivial problem that can&#8217;t properly be tackled in the ad-hoc fashion we tried. Should this topic ever resurface at my company I&#8217;ll definitely try to go for a more elaborate and scientific approach.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty of the paper</strong><br />
I know that for some people the math might look scary, but if you take some time and look at it carefully you&#8217;ll notice that it&#8217;s actually rather simple. It probably doesn&#8217;t hurt to be acquainted with some basic concepts of <span class="caps">NLP</span> and machine learning, but if you have those it&#8217;s quite an enjoyable paper even if you are not an absolute crack in the field.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://mrjaba.posterous.com/">Tom</a> and I read another paper, this time on prototypical inheritance: <a href="http://selflanguage.org/documentation/published/organizing-programs.html">Organizing Programs Without Classes</a>. You can find his post <a href="http://mrjaba.posterous.com/organizing-programs-without-classes">here</a> and I have to admit that he also did almost the entire summary this time whereas I only added some minor things and code examples.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><span class="caps">OOP</span> is a paradigm which uses &#8220;objects&#8221; to encapsulate behavior and state in a programming language. This can be accomplished in a few ways, two of the more popular being class based and prototype based object orientation. In class based object models (e.g. Java) a class will be written to define the behavior and state that the object will embody. A class can be inherited from and extended to provide new functionality. In prototype based object models (e.g. ECMAScript, Io), there are no classes, only objects which can be cloned and altered to provide new features. Here&#8217;s a quick comparison of the two approaches in Ruby and ECMAScript:</p>

<p>Class based inheritance purports many organizational benefits. Do prototype based languages share them? The paper looks at each benefit in turn and shows approaches to add these features into classless languages or even improve upon them.</p>
<p><em>Behaviour Sharing:<br />
</em>In class based programming languages code re-use is easy, you can inherit from a class and you&#8217;ll get access to that class&#8217;s methods and member variables.</p>
<p>In prototype based languages a clone/copy method is written on a prototypical object which can define which data members and methods are copied to the new object. This idea can be refined to an object whose sole purpose is to supply behavior, a trait. This can be a parent object of the new object to provide its functionality. As this trait object is shared amongst all clones, any changes to it affect the clones, just as with the class and subclass of class based programming. Here&#8217;s an example on behavior sharing in a prototype based language (Io):</p>
<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><em>Representation Sharing:</em><br />
In class based languages, subclassing gives the child class access to the member variables of the parent, its representation. In prototype based languages, a trait object provides only behavior, not data. This job is performed by a prototype instance of the object, one every other object will be cloned from. Its clone method will copy across its data slots (member variables) with any default values the programmer has provided. This is called a &#8220;Data Parent&#8221;.</p>

<em>Dynamic Behaviour Changes &#8211; Changing an instance&#8217;s class and dynamic inheritance:<br />
</em><em>Tom:</em> This was a section of particular interest, mainly because I think it&#8217;s not quite as skewed as they portray it. The idea is that because in a prototype based model the reference to the parent object (traits, data) is simply a reference it can be changed very easily depending on the state the object is in. This provides new functionality as the object goes through its life. In a class based model, changing an instance&#8217;s class is difficult at best and not a good idea, however the idea of changing behavior based on state is still a useful concept. The authors however seem to miss the concept of composition and delegation, it&#8217;s next to trivial to change the behavior of an object simply by changing the object that is providing a function, just take a look at the Strategy Pattern for an example.<br />
<em>Michael:</em> This paper is from 1991, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Gang of Four book on Design Patterns</a> from 1994, so I guess you&#8217;re blaming the authors for not knowing about something that hasn&#8217;t been published when they wrote their paper.<br />
<em>Tom:</em> Fair point! I wonder when the concept of delegation was first coined?<br />
<em>Michael:</em> According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_(programming)">Wikipedia</a> in a paper from 1986, &#8220;Using Prototypical Objects to Implement Shared Behavior in Object-Oriented Systems&#8221;.</p>

<p>Changing the prototype can entirely change the behavior of an object.</p>
<p><em>Naming and Categorising:<br />
</em>This feature is vital in any nontrivial system, without being able to find code to serve its purpose the programmer would be constantly rewriting the same code over and over. Class based languages tend to provide a globally accessible name for a set of functions. They also tend to provide namespaces to prevent naming collisions or categorisation. Prototype based languages need to be able to access the prototype anywhere in the system to be cloned, but as they are just regular objects, they have no internal names. The authors of the paper propose that namespace objects can be used to fill this need. Essentially a globally accessible hash map, which can contain nested namespace objects to provide categorisation. This later emerged as a fairly common pattern in ECMAScript.</p>

<p>Note that TopLevel is simply an object literal.</p>
<p>The naming of these type of systems is highly dependent on the structure of the system, this type of naming is called Extensional naming. Intensional naming is the term given to systems where the name of classes is defined by the programmer and not necessarily related to the structure of the system. The authors claim that Extensional naming has a few key advantages:</p>
<p>1) It&#8217;s free with a classless language; no other constructs are required for this behaviour to work.<br />
2) The names are also expressions, and as this is code it can have additional interpretations.<br />
3) Intensional naming can become inconsistent quite easily.</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s not convinced any of these reasons are actually advantages: 1) just because a system comes with a feature doesn&#8217;t mean you should use it if there is a better alternative available &#8211; prototype based models don&#8217;t seem to have much of an alternative. 2) because it is code and not a simple lookup this is more complicated and has more potential for error. 3) this is probably valid. Changing a class name does require it to be updated everywhere in the system, but with refactoring tools this is mitigated.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
</strong>This was a pretty interesting paper. Personally I&#8217;ve always been drawn to Io, but never got past the &#8220;playing around&#8221; stage with it. Checking out Self also is on my todo list. I think there&#8217;s a certain elegance to prototype based object orientation and I&#8217;d like to research it a bit more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Disclaimer: <a href="http://www.nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a> were nice enough to provide me with a free copy of the book reviewed here but what I&#8217;m about to write has not been influenced by this.</em></p>
<p>Properly learning Haskell has been on my todo list for years. One of my first more serious attempts was in 2009, when I found <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">a weird little book with lots of cartoons online</a>. As you may have guessed that was Miran Lipovaca&#8217;s &#8220;Learn You a Haskell for Great Good&#8221; and I was immediately intrigued by the writing style and cute cartoons. However back then the book was still a work in progress and I eventually stopped reading it before Miran got around to adding the last chapters. I always promised myself to eventually revisit this later, so I was delighted when I found out that No Starch Press is actually releasing an offline version of the book! Here you can see the cover in its full cartoony glory:<br />
<img class="aligncenter" style="border-width: 2px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Learn You A Haskell cover" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.posterous.com/teddythebear/1XvdQkcaG7iWYJB8XYQeLVwwt5VGYAcxGPa1PNdigVpx60HxVtEQphHTlXEI/LearnYouAHaskell.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJFZAE65UYRT34AOQ&Expires=1319408436&Signature=woTKJQqeEIU9zs1Ib3AfV64gtfY%3D" alt="Learn You A Haskell cover" width="170" height="225" align="centre" border="1" /></p>
<p>Before you think this book is all about funny drawings, lets talk about the real star, the content. <span class="caps">LYAH</span> definitely is among the top programming books I read so far. Due to the author&#8217;s easy-going and funny style &mdash; though I&#8217;m sure there will be some readers who won&#8217;t appreciate his humor &mdash; you might not even notice at first how choke-full of good content this book is, but once you are done with it you realize that you actually learned a lot. This would be an amazing feat for any technical book, but is even more impressive considering Haskell&#8217;s reputation as being a very academical and arcane language. Sure, not everything is covered here &mdash; Arrows or <span class="caps">CPS</span> come to mind &mdash; but every book is finite and the selection of topics is absolutely appropriate for beginning Haskell enthusiasts. The only chapter I wasn&#8217;t so happy with was the last one on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper">Zippers</a>, not because it wasn&#8217;t well written or interesting, but more because it felt a bit tucked on.</p>
<p>What can you expect from this book? Will you be a Haskell guru after reading it? Most likely not, because that takes a long time of practice and actually writing code. Maybe that&#8217;s one of the few weak points of <span class="caps">LYAH</span>, the code examples are usually rather short and focussed on getting the point across, not &#8220;real-world&#8221; tasks you are likely to encounter in day to day programming. They still are great for introducing the reader to Haskell&#8217;s way of abstracting problems, which I find immensely beautiful and well thought out. Still, a chapter or two on &#8220;programming in the large&#8221; and how to structure a big Haskell project would have been nice additions, but there are other places for learning more about the language, e.g. the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell wiki</a> or the <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=haskell%20wikibook&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;fp=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;cad=b">Haskell Wikibook</a>. What the book will do for you is that once you are done with it, you should have a good basic understanding of the language&#8217;s key concepts and type system and will be comfortable around terms like &#8220;monoid&#8221;, &#8220;applicative functor&#8221; and &#8220;monad&#8221;. There still we be a long way to go before you can consider yourself a Haskell expert, but you&#8217;ll have a very solid grounding to build on.</p>
<p>All in all this is a remarkable book and maybe just what this beautiful language was missing, an easy to read, entertaining yet still thorough introduction to the language, that gives you an idea that Haskell is not only a research subject for computer scientists but a useful tool that can be used to build software.</p></div>
