  <div class="entry-content"><p>Say you live in a country where access to information isn&#8217;t as free as it should be. Sure, there are a lot of free proxy servers you could use, but unfortunately they tend to get blocked after a while. <a href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor</a> would also be an option, but unfortunately it&#8217;s not always as fast as we&#8217;d like it to be (run more servers, folks!).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I thought I&#8217;ll show you another possibility to get the information you want without somebody censoring it:<ol><br />
<li>Get yourself a <a href="http://www.ductape.net/~mitja/freeunix.shtml">free <span class="caps">UNIX</span> shell account</a> which is accessible by <span class="caps">SSH</span> (consider using <a href="http://pkeck.myweb.uga.edu/ssh/"><span class="caps">SSH</span> keys</a> for authentification).</li></p>
<li>Use ssh&#8217;s cool &#8220;-D&#8221; option to start a local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS"><span class="caps">SOCKS</span> proxy</a>.<br />
<br />
Example: ssh -D 9999 youraccount@somefreeshellserver.com. Consider adding this to some startup script to make life easier in the future.</li>
<li>Configure your browser to use localhost:9999 as a SOCKS5 proxy. If you&#8217;re using Firefox, consider using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2648/">MM3-ProxySwitch</a> or <a href="http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/">FoxyProxy</a>.</li>
<li>Voila, from now on every connection you make will go over an ecrypted connection to the <span class="caps">SSH</span> server which unlike the site you really want to access isn&#8217;t blocked. The server will then perform your originally planned connection and forward the results to you (once again encrypted and not coming from a blocked IP). And of course this doesn&#8217;t only work with browsers, but all applications supporting <span class="caps">SOCKS</span> proxies. Additionally <a href="http://tsocks.sourceforge.net/">tsocks</a> may help with applications which normally don&#8217;t support <span class="caps">SOCKS</span> servers.</li>
<li>If you experience connection problems and are suspecting that someone has tampered with the name servers in order to deliver bogus results for certain sites (bad government, no cookie!) make sure that the option &#8220;network.proxy.socks_remote_dns&#8221; in Firefox&#8217;s about:config is set to true, because then <span class="caps">DNS</span> lookups will be performed at the <span class="caps">SSH</span> server.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&quot;s it, please leave a commentary if you have any questions or suggestions regarding this little tip or if you just want to provide me with some feedback how this worked for you.</p>

<p>Conclusion:<br />
As usual the C3 was a blast: interesting lectures, meeting nice people, and generally having a good time with friends is what makes this event a highlight for me. This year&#8217;s congress seemed a little less organized and more chaotic than 22C3, but in a way that was quite refreshing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lectures seen on day 2:</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1738.en.html"><em>MMORPGs</em></a><br />
Although I&#8217;m not into WoW myself, I was looking forward to see <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi</a> talk again at the C3. As expected his lecture was quite entertaining and since it wasn&#8217;t about a &#8220;heavy&#8221; topic it was a perfect starter for what would become a pretty long day.</p>
<p><a href="https://events.congress.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1444.en.html"><em>Tor and China</em></a><br />
As you might know I&#8217;m a big supporter of <a href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor</a> and have studied Chinese for several years, so this was a lecture I was obviously really interested in. The talk was pretty nice, although it didn&#8217;t offer too much for people already familiar with Tor. Besides that I was a little disappointed that it  actually had so little to do with China, that one could easily have used $genericEvilCountry as an adequate substitute.</p>
<p><a href="https://events.congress.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1500.en.html"><em>Hackerspaces</em></a><br />
<a href="http://metalab.at/">Metalab</a>, <a href="http://c-base.org/">C-Base</a> and <a href="http://netzladen.org">Netzladen</a> introduced their projects and the challenges involved in creating a Hackerspace in a light-hearted way which was just perfect for me since I was quite tired at that time.</p>
<p><a href="https://events.congress.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1381.en.html"><em>Stealth malware &#8211; can good guys win?</em></a><br />
<a href="http://invisiblethings.org/">Joanna Rutkowska</a> is gorgeous and clever, so she can basically talk about whatever she wants and I will want to marry her afterwards.</p>
<p><a href="https://events.congress.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1651.en.html"><I>Ãœberwachen und Strafen in Entenhausen</I></a><br />
Ok, but not as funny as her talk 2 years ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://events.congress.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1428.en.html"><em>You can&#8217;t make this stuff up</em></a><br />
You can&#8217;t blame Fefe and Ilja for trying, but <span class="caps">IMHO</span> this was only a weak substitute for the &#8220;Literatisches Code-Quartett&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the real highlight of the day started at around midnight, when <a href="http://www.monochrom.at">Monochrom</a> started to perform what they call &#8220;proto-melodischen interventionismus&#8221;. It&#8217;s pretty hard to describe how funny this spontaneous concert which moved through the whole building really was if you haven&#8217;t been there, so you just have to believe me that this was great stuff!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lectures seen on day 1:</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1256.de.html"><em>Who can you trust?</em></a><br />
Business as usual: introduction by Tim Pritlove, followed by the keynote. This year&#8217;s speaker was <a href="http://www.eff.org/~barlow/">EFF&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a>, who talked about ethics and responsibility in the hacker community. Quite nice, although I wasn&#8217;t all too fond of the way he encouraged people to police their fellow hackers. But for me the most interesting thing possibly was the confirmation of a Chaos Communication Camp in August 2007!</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1656.de.html"><em>Design and Implementation of an object-oriented, secure <span class="caps">TCP</span>/IP Stack</em></a><br />
Quite interesting and despite Andreas Bogk&#8217;s involvement it didn&#8217;t include too much <a href="http://www.opendylan.org/">Dylan</a> advocacy.</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1461.en.html"><em>The Grim Meathook Future</em></a><br />
Despite not really having a concept, this lecture wasn&#8217;t all bad. The speaker was a quite funny and opinionated guy, as were the people who joined the discussion in the end. Nothing great, but quite entertaining.</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1761.en.html"><em>Dylan Introduction</em></a> <br />
No concept, terrible English, and altogether not really informative &#8211; at least if this wasn&#8217;t your first contact with Dylan.</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1402.en.html"><em>Drones</em></a><br />
My personal highlight for the day: interesting topic, good and funny presentation, motivating people to go out and have fun. That&#8217;s how talks at the <span class="caps">CCC</span> should be.</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1537.de.html"><em>Know Your Citizens</em></a><br />
<a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1692.en.html"><em>Hacking the Electoral Law</em></a><br />
<a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1423.en.html"><em>We don&#8217;t trust voting computers</em></a><br />
<a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1555.en.html"><em>Revenge of the Female Nerds</em></a><br />
Since I&#8217;ve been to this talks but haven&#8217;t payed close attention (<span class="caps">IRC</span>, surfing, working on a MySQL problem with berq etc.), I can&#8217;t really say much about them. I picked up the occasional interesting fact, but other than that I don&#8217;t think I really missed much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a mostly sleepless bus journey and &#8220;some&#8221; waiting, we&#8217;ve finally made it to the already quite busy <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Hackcenter">Hackcenter</a>, where we met a few people we know from previous years. About half an hour ago the queue at the ticket counter was way too long, so we&#8217;re trying our luck a little later. Since we&#8217;re getting up quite early tomorrow (around 9am) to see the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1256.en.html">keynote</a>, I&#8217;ll try to catch a few more hours of sleep tonight.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a little less than four hours, <a href="http:berq.net">berq</a>, <a href="http://twoday.tuwien.ac.at/perm">lippi</a>, <a href="http://red667.org">red667</a>, and me will leave for Berlin where we&#8217;re going to attend the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Home">23C3</a>. Since the <a href="http://oebb.at">Ã–BB</a> still sucks, we&#8217;re once again going by bus, arriving tomorrow at around 6:30am. Judging from last year the time between our arrival until we can check into our <a href="http://www.hostels.com/en/availability.php/HostelNumber.10594">hostel</a> at around noon will be spent drinking beer, which definitely isn&#8217;t a recommended breakfast option. Kids, don&#8217;t try this at home!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we&#8217;ll once again have loads of fun, and unlike the last years I plan on regularly blogging and posting pics from the event, so stay tuned! Anyone interested in meeting up at the 23C3 either post a comment here or send a mail to my GMail account.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Jethro Tull, Christmas song</strong></p>
<p>Once in Royal David&#8217;s City<br />
Stood a lonely cattle shed<br />
Where a mother held her baby<br />
You&#8217;d do well to remember the things He later said</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re stuffing yourselves at the Christmas parties<br />
You&#8217;ll just laugh when I tell you to take a running jump<br />
You&#8217;re missing the point I&#8217;m sure does not need making<br />
That Christmas spirit is not what you drink</p>
<p>So how can you laugh when your own mother&#8217;s hungry<br />
And how can you smile when the reasons for smiling are wrong?<br />
And if I just messed up your thoughtless pleasures<br />
Remember, if you wish, this is just a Christmas song</p>
<p>(Hey, Santa! Pass us that bottle, will you?)_</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I&#8217;ve blogged about me being uncertain whether to get myself a Nintento Wii or an Xbox 360 (please don&#8217;t tell me to get both, that thought is too tempting already!). Currently Big N&#8217;s latest offering is a slight favorite again, since &#8211; after an exhausting few days partying &#8211; I spent the late afternoon and early evening playing <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/556/556422p1.html">Paper Mario: The Thounsand-Year Door</a>, which is one of the most entertaining and funny games I&#8217;ve ever played. Later on I decided to finally try out the <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> with Mario Kart DS (friend code: 197655187733), and I have to say that I just love it, which means that now I really have to get myself a copy of <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/697/697307p1.html">Metroid Prime Hunters</a> as soon as possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you may know I&#8217;m a big fan of video game consoles. I currently own two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES"><span class="caps">NES</span></a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNES"><span class="caps">SNES</span></a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Drive">Mega Drive</a>  (aka Genesis), a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playstation">PS1</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Cube">Game Cube</a> and loads of games. I also played quite a lot on the other systems common in Europe (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn">Saturn</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N64">N64</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS2">PS2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox">Xbox</a>). Among the listed systems, the Dreamcast is probably still my favorite for being really innovative and having lots of great games, with the GC coming in a close second. But I&#8217;ve had great times with all of them &#8211; the original Mario Kart on the <span class="caps">SNES</span> and most Square titles on the PS1 come to mind. Of course I also love handhelds and own an original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> (which is unfortunately broken), a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBA"><span class="caps">GBA</span></a> and a black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Lite">Nintendo DS LIte</a>, which <span class="caps">IMHO</span> is the coolest portable gaming system I&#8217;ve ever seen (with honorable mentions for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Nomad">Sega Nomad</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Express">Turbo Express</a>).</p>
<p>As you can see I own everything Nintendo ever made except for the N64, which too had a lot of great games but which I somehow never bought. And I really love their products. But I also was always very fond of Sega&#8217;s systems, and when the company announced that they wouldn&#8217;t produce any more consoles after the DC, I was pretty sure that I won&#8217;t buy another game console ever. That held true for a surprisingly long time, until I got myself a GC at the beginning of this year, because (1) the console fever got me again and (2) it was ridiculously cheap because it was already close to the end of it&#8217;s life cycle. And although I currently hardly take the time to play with the systems I already own, I&#8217;m considering buying a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games_%28seventh_generation_era%29">seventh generation console</a>.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a> vs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3">PS3</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a>. I&#8217;m definitely not going to get myself a PS3. First off I&#8217;m not interested in Blu-ray, <span class="caps">HDMI</span> and the other fancy stuff, and secondly I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Copy_Protection">Sony sucks</a>. Besides that at least two of my friends will get one, so I can play the newest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Evolution_Soccer"><span class="caps">PES</span></a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29"><span class="caps">GTA</span></a> with them. So of course the Wii would be an obvious choice: it has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess">Twilight Princess</a>, is made by Nintendo and features this incredibly cool controller. And did I mention  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess">Twilight Princess</a>? Besides that it offers wireless, the option to play my GC games (I could save a little room by storing the GC someplace else), a cool download feature and I&#8217;m sure there will be interesting possibilities to use it in conjunction with the DS. But yesterday I suddenly realized that I never considered the Xbox 360. None of my friends has one, and nobody mentioned any plans to buy it. So I read up on it a little, and somehow I started to like the system. Sure, it&#8217;s made by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">the big evil company</a> and it doesn&#8217;t exactly offer original games. But it has <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/744/744356p1.html">Gears of War</a>, <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/741/741860p1.html">F.E.A.R</a>, <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/717/717824p1.html">Prey</a> and a lot more good shooters. And I really like playing shooters. Then there&#8217;s <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/698/698400p1.html">Oblivion</a>, which by itself may justify getting a 360. Considering the upcoming <a href="http://halo3.com/">Halo 3</a> and <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/707/707567p1.html">Star Trek Legacy</a>, the system might well be worth its money for me. Plus I&#8217;ve never owned a Microsoft console. Actually I was pretty sure I never will, but since <a href="http://gnulords.org/~colo/">colo</a> mentioned that he&#8217;s interested in a <span class="caps">PSP</span>, I&#8217;m surprised by anything anymore.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m still pondering wether to buy a new console or not, but if I do, I&#8217;m not sure anymore that I will be a Wii.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As always December turns out to be the busiest month of the year: Last Monday I met up with <a href="http://berq.net/">berq</a> and <a href="http://gnulords.org/~colo/misc/quotes.txt">colo</a> for beer, dinner and nerd talk, which I really enjoyed. On Thursday the ominous <a href="http://blingblingsquad.net/">[[:bbs:]]</a> had its Christmas party, which as expected led to loads of consumed alcohol and a headache on the next day. Nonetheless I joined the Viennese <a href="http://www.pardus.at">Pardus</a> meeting on Friday after having dinner with Silvia and a friend of hers. Yesterday <a href="http://www.cargal.org">Steve</a> came to Vienna, so we and some other friends went to have dinner (best Sushi I ever enjoyed outside of Asia) and some drinks afterwards. Since this week&#8217;s schedule didn&#8217;t leave me enough time to attend my Taekwondo classes, I got up after ~6h of sleep this morning to attend the class at 10:00am.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all, as next week will be equally busy: On Wednesday I&#8217;m going to see <a href="http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/">Placebo</a> at the <a href="http://www.stadthalle.com/">Wiener Stadthalle</a>. Yes, that&#8217;s quite different from the rather small punk and hardcore concerts I usually go to, but I somehow like them and want to see if they&#8217;ll live up to their good reputation as a live band. On Thursday yours truly will attend the Christmas party of his former employer, while on Friday my current company will have one. Saturday I&#8217;ll meet up with a friend of mine who&#8217;s visiting from Beijing, while I plan on spending a relaxing day at the spa on Sunday.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell now the week before Christmas will also be full with dinners, parties and other appointments, and the week after that I&#8217;m in Berlin for the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Home">23C3</a>. To cut a long story short: if you&#8217;re interested in a meeting either join me for one of the activities listed above or you&#8217;ll probably have to wait until 2007. Wow, I feel important now.</p>
