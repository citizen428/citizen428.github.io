  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve done it. I decided to finally get my first Mac and ordered one of those nifty new Intel Mac Minis. Since it will mainly be used for mailing, surfing the web and other things which don&#8217;t need lots of <span class="caps">CPU</span> cycles, I&#8217;ve decided to go for the Core Solo, which should be more than enough for my needs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to have a new machine to play around with, and I think I&#8217;ll have lots of fun installing Gentoo on the Mac Mini (dual boot) and giving <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/macos/">Gentoo for MacOS X</a> a try.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a pretty long period of not doing any work related to Gentoo (blame my boss) I&#8217;ve finally come around to put together the upgrade of the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-freebsd.xml">Gentoo/FreeBSD documentation</a> I promised <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~flameeyes/">Diego</a> quite some time ago. I&#8217;m sure that our nice documentation developers will commit this soon!</p>
<p>Next week will again be rather busy because my girlfriend and me are moving to a new apartment, but after that I hope I&#8217;ll be able to regularly contribute to Gentoo again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Disclaimer: This is a rant. It will be unfair and biased. Live with or go away.</em></p>
<p>Ok, here we go: I hate the Lucky Couple&#8482;! Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m no frustrated sicko who hates all happy people in his vicinity, at least not most of the time. It&#8217;s just that I really can&#8217;t stand that particular kind of couple who are so offensively in love that the average Hollywood love story seems like a Homerian tragedy when comared to the uberhappy Lucky Couple&#8482;. Really, if you&#8217;re in a restaurant and all you are doing is petting on the verge to hard-core pornography, either go home or at least have the decency to go all the way and give the people around you something to see. Actually being happy, kissing and everything else the average couple does is perfectly ok, but I absolutely hate the way the Lucky Couple&#8482; involves the whole room in their private life without realizing that WE DON&#8217;T <span class="caps">CARE</span>. Really. We don&#8217;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Saturday, February 18:</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.teemow.de">teemow</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/peppertwin/">Steffi</a> came from Cologne to Vienna. Spent the night at <a href="http://b72.at/">B72</a>, <a href="http://www.chelsea.co.at/">Chelsea</a> and <a href="http://www.elektro-g.at/">Elektro Gönner</a>. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, February 19:</strong><br />
Had a decent brunch with my girlfriend at <a href="http://www.restaurant-leopold.at/">Restaurant Leopold</a>. Then had some coffee at the <a href="http://www.bluebox.at/">Bluebox</a> with teemow, Steffi and Laki. The &#8220;Coheed and Cambrea&#8221; concert in the evening got postponed again, so I went to the &#8220;Einhorn&#8221; with my former flatmate Doris to have some beers&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, February 21:</strong><br />
Attended the IT Suppliers Day of one of our customers. Went to Laki&#8217;s place with my girlfriend in the evening to have some Caipiroskas with him, teemow and Steffi.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, February 22:</strong><br />
Met my co-conspirators (details to follow) <a href="http://berq.net/blog/">berq</a> and <a href="http://gnulords.org/~colo/serendipity/">colo</a> (who now has a blog too) at the Käuzchen. Got drunk again, but it was definitely worth it&#8230; ;)</p>
<p><strong>Friday, February 24:</strong><br />
Had some great lunch &#8211; Seafood Soup and Walleye In White Wine Sauce &#8211; at Alberto&#8217;s with my boss and the <a href="http://www.wcm.at"><span class="caps">WCM</span></a> guys. I&#8217;ll do a nice article series for them starting in June. More info will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, February 25:</strong><br />
Went to the office for a workshop (around 2,5 hours), which was actually pretty informative and nice. Started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/3453400526/026-7600414-8433267">The Cocka Hola Company</a> and love it.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, February 26:</strong><br />
Had brunch with Karin and Andi at the <a href="http://lokaltipp.at/lokale/homepage_9_1034">Lux</a>, which <span class="caps">IMHO</span> offers one of the best breakfast deals in town (all you can eat buffet with <strong>great</strong> antipasti and lots of other good stuff for Euro 8,40!). Highly recommended!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;but it bought me a Game Cube.</p>
<p>Today at work I got so p*ssed that I decided to go out and spend some money on stuff I don&#8217;t really need. In the end I bought a Nintendo Game Cube, <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-652">Mario Kart Double Dash!!</a>, a memory card, and an additional controller in a shop close to my work, as well as a copy of <a href="http://metroid.com/prime/">Metroid Prime</a> on eBay which I should get in a few days.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">FAQ</span></strong><br />
<em>Q: You know that capitalism only works by making you so depressed that you just need to buy something in order to feel better?</em><br />
A: Yes, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m also pretty ashamed every time I fall for this, but sometimes you just can&#8217;t help it&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Q: Don&#8217;t you think that sucks then?</em><br />
A: Sure I do, but you can&#8217;t get drunk all the time.</p>
<p><em>Q: Why a Game Cube and not a PS2/X-Box/whatever?</em><br />
A: I&#8217;ve collected game consoles starting from the old <span class="caps">NES</span> until Sega stopped producing their own consoles after my beloved Dreamcast. Personally I just think that Nintendo and Sega rock, while MS and Sony&#8230;ahm&#8230;just don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t need the newest and greatest hardware, I just want a nice platform which offers the kind of games I like to play. Additionally I already own a Game Boy Advance for several years, which can be used in conjuction with the Game Cube.</p>
<p><em>Q: You could have bought that Game Cube a lot earlier.</em><br />
A: That&#8217;s not a question.</p>
<p><em>Q: But still&#8230;</em><br />
Well, after Sega announced that they won&#8217;t release any new consoles, I got so depressed and ended my career as a video game collector (I never really liked PC games). Now that I spontanously changed my mind, the Game Cube was the only system I considered worth buying. No flame wars please, I quite regularly play PS2 and X-Box games when hanging out with friends, I just don&#8217;t want to spend my own money on those particular systems.</p>
<p><em>Q: Will you start blogging about Game Cube games now?</em><br />
A: There might be the occasional post on this topic, but this site definitely won&#8217;t turn into a gaming blog.</p>
<p><em>Q: What about the revolution?</em><br />
See blog subtitle.</p>
<p><em>Q: Have you turned into a bitter cynic lately?</em><br />
You&#8217;ve noticed? If I only knew what could be the <a href="http://citizen428.net/archives/254-Why-working-in-Business-IT-sucks.html">reason</a>&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve been to the Depeche Mode concert in the <a href="http://stadthalle.at">Wiener Stadthalle</a> last Thursday. Although it was quite nice, concerts this big definitely aren&#8217;t my thing. They are more like Hollywood movies: good while they last, but nothing life changing or overly surprising. I much more enjoy small Punk or Hardcore concerts, where you can have a beer and a nice chat with the band afterwards and generally feel much more involved&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://teemow.com/">teemow</a> and his girlfriend are going to stay in Vienna for a few days, so I guess we&#8217;ll go out partying tonight which should be good fun! :)</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll have brunch at <a href="http://www.restaurant-leopold.at/">Restaurant Leopold</a> with my girlfriend and will go to see <a href="http://www.thejrewing.com/">JR Ewing</a> and <a href="http://www.coheedandcambria.com/">Coheed and Cambria</a> in the <a href="http://www.arena.co.at/">Arena Wien</a> with my former flatmate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>1. You&#8217;ll turn into a bitter cynic. This in fact is probably the best thing about your job, which really  should make you think&#8230;</p>
<p>2. Only wackos and smartasses work in this field. Depending on which group you belong to, this might even be fun. More often though you&#8217;re screwed.</p>
<p>3. If your boss screws up, it will probably get communicated to the customer as your fault. Given that you took the job in the first place, that&#8217;s even true.</p>
<p>4. Every job where people tell you things along the line of &#8220;An average day has 24 hours and if that isn&#8217;t enough, you&#8217;ll have to make use of the nights too!&#8221; and find that actually funny, is a good reason to spend the rest of your life in a zen buddhist monastery, a mental home or both.</p>
<p>5. The best thing about your average work day is that there&#8217;s always at least one person in the office who is worse off than you (see #1). However, he&#8217;s most likely also the one poor guy who&#8217;s neither a wacko nor a smartass (see #2), so you have to control your bitter cynicism and feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>6. The coffee is cold or bad and the coke is either warm or a diet coke. They&#8217;ve thought about everything!</p>
<p>7. After a certain amount of time you won&#8217;t be able to remember if the sentences &#8220;Resistance is futile. Your life as it has been is over. From this time forward, you will service us.&#8221; have been said by your boss or Locutus of Borg. What&#8217;s even worse is that it doesn&#8217;t really make a difference anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;m also planning on writing up some reasons for &#8220;Why working in Business IT rocks&#8221;. Yeah, right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Personal:</strong><br />
Yesterday I had the last seminar of my university &#8220;career&#8221;, which feels kind of strange. As the people who know me better can tell you, for the past few years I&#8217;ve always been torn between a job in the technical field and pursuing an academic career in humanities. Now that I&#8217;ve surprisingly found a job which allows me to work full time on/with free software, it seems that this decision has finally been made, but there still is a certain amount of uncertainty&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong><br />
During yesterday&#8217;s lunch break we&#8217;ve been to a nice <a href="http://falter.at/web/wwei/detail.php?nr=679&amp;ref=bezirk%3D9%26kueche%3D231%26teil%3D1">Korean restaurant</a> which offers nice set meals (consisting of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miso_soup">miso soup</a>, a salad and a main course) in the range of 6,20-10,20 Euro. The beef <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibimbap">bibimbap</a> is great and everything else also was really good.</p>
<p>In the evening we&#8217;ve ordered a nice pizza which goes really well with Friday night TV, and today I&#8217;ll meet some friends at the <a href="http://www.blunzenstricker.at/">Blunzenstricker</a> to have some solid Austrian food. :)</p>
<p><strong>Books:</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve just finished J.G. Ballard&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/000225848X/002-3286426-3377608?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Millenium People</a> which I wholeheartedly recommend to everyone! Currently I&#8217;m reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345404475/qid=1139069018/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-3286426-3377608?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a> by Philip K. Dick, which is long overdue given that I have seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</a> a gazillion times but never actually came around to read the book.</p>
<p>As it&#8217;s pretty thin I went to a book store today and came home with <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/3453400526/202-6097115-8739022">The Cocka Hola company</a> by Matias Faldbakken, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156029987/qid=1139068428/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/002-3286426-3377608?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">Vernon God Little</a> by <span class="caps">DBC</span> Pierre and Alan Bisset&#8217;s <a href="http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/incredibleadamspark.html">The incredible Adam Spark</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This will probably result in a flamewar, but I&#8217;m really interested in hearing all your opinions here: after a long time of avoiding any desktop related software looking even remotely like it might have to do with <span class="caps">KDE</span>/QT and following <span class="caps">GNOME</span> development pretty closely, I&#8217;ve finally decided to have a look at <span class="caps">KDE</span> again.</p>
<p>To my surprise I quite like what I see. Especially Kontact looks like a spiffy piece of software, but other applications seem to be pretty cool too.</p>
<p>I soon should get a work laptop, and I&#8217;ll only install <span class="caps">KDE</span> on it to see how I like it for perfoming my day to day tasks. Everyone deserves a fair chance, I&#8217;ve once even tried Emacs for a few days to see why I love Vim ;) Once I start this little experiment, I&#8217;ll try to ocassionally blog about my experiences. Any <span class="caps">KDE</span> fans out there, please post some comments and tell me about cool stuff you think I should try/know about/whatever&#8230;</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>: E17 also seems to have improved quite a lot since I&#8217;ve last installed it, and it looks really sweet.</p>
<p>BTW2: I&#8217;ve recently also rediscovered my love for Ion3, so here&#8217;s right another contestor for the &#8220;citizen428&#8217;s preffered <span class="caps">GUI</span>&#8221; competition&#8230;</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a little info for the people who may wonder about my lack of activity lately (mainly the Ruby herd and some guys of the Gentoo/<span class="caps">ALT</span> project): I&#8217;ve started a new job as a Junior Systems Engineer for a company providing open source solutions for enterprise customers, which means I&#8217;ve recently been playing around with stuff like Linux Heartbeat and other cool technologies. It&#8217;s quite stressful, but also pretty interesting so far and I quite like it (despite my constant rambling about having a regular job).</p>
<p>However, in January I also had to finish the last few classes of my college career, so there actually was nearly no time left for Gentoo, as the measly 4 commits I did demonstrate pretty well. I still have a seminar this Friday where I&#8217;ll present the concept of my diploma thesis, but starting from next week I&#8217;ll try to do more Gentoo related things again. :)</p></div>
