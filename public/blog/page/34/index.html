  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you know me, you also know how much I love food. I can&#8217;t think of many things which are better than spending a nice evening with friends in a restaurant, having a great dinner and an interesting conversation.</p>
<p>My favorite food definitely comes from East Asian cuisines, which may or may not have to do with the fact that I&#8217;ve lived in China for a while. It&#8217;s hard to choose between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine">Chinese</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cuisine">Japanese</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_cuisine">Korean</a> food, because all of these countries have great dishes: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_pao_chicken">Gongbao jiding</a> anyone? Or do you prefer some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakitori">Yakitori</a>? Or maybe have some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgogi">Bulgogi</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve established that East Asian food is just great, it&#8217;s time to talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_food/">another country&#8217;s great cuisine</a>: Turkey! Yep, I just love Turkish food! Come on, they have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%B6ner_Kebab">Döner Kebab</a>, Dürüm Kebab, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahmacun">Lahmacun</a> (a kind of pizza), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzatziki">cacik</a>, Köfte (delicious meatballs), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolma">Dolma</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrek">Börek</a> and lots of other great stuff. And don&#8217;t even get me started on the desserts&#8230; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">Baklava</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halvah">Helva</a>, followed by some nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee">Turkish coffee</a>. And I haven&#8217;t even talked about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayran">Ayran</a> and all the other great Turkish food and drinks that come to my mind&#8230; Luckily enough Austria (and to an even larger extent Germany) has lots of Turkish fast-food joints and restaurants, so I just can go and get me one of my favorite dishes whenever I feel like it. :) <span class="caps">BTW</span>: <a href="http://berq.net/">Berg</a>, if you&#8217;re reading this, invite me for dinner and cook some great Turkish food&#8230; ;)</p>
<p>To finish off this topic I&#8217;ll give you some links to a type of food which is almost too good to really be true, namely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uighur">Uighur</a> cuisine, which combines elements from Chinese, Turkish and Arabic food: <a href="http://www.wiu.edu/users/mua/food.htm">Uighur Food</a>, <a href="http://the_uighurs.tripod.com/UighurCuisine.htm">The Uighurs &#8211; Cuisine</a> and <a href="http://www.chinavista.com/experience/xinjiang/cuisine.html">Xinjiang-Style Cuisine</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember the band <a href="http://www.fgth.org.uk/">Frankie Goes To Hollywood</a>? That&#8217;s good, but actually they have nothing to do with this blog entry, except for one thing: they&#8217;ve once recorded a song called &#8220;Relax&#8221; and that&#8217;s what I finally managed to do today! :)</p>
<p>After feeling pretty burned out recently, my girlfriend and me decided to spend an evening at the <a href="http://oberlaa.at/">spa</a>. We haven&#8217;t done this for ages, but it was exactly what I needed to get my head free again. When we arrived there I thought I&#8217;m going to mostly swim lanes, but then I decided that I do enough of those at my weekly waterpolo training&#8230; That&#8217;s why in the end we opted for a wellness program, including water massage, sauna and other nice things.</p>
<p>To make a long story short: I&#8217;m really relaxed and feel more motivated again, so the whole thing really was worth the 10 Euro it cost me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While my girlfriend was visiting her sister in Rotterdam, I finally set up her notebook to dual boot Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux. Before you think bad of me: I didn&#8217;t sneakily do this without her knowing, but instead because she once mentioned that she&#8217;d like to try out another OS.</p>
<p>Now you may wonder why I chose Ubuntu over Gentoo, but I&#8217;m afraid the answer is rather pragmatic and uninspired: I had a magazine CD of the current release, so I dind&#8217;t have to download an <span class="caps">ISO</span>. Also installation is fast and painless and there are lots of nice HOWTOs. Besides that I&#8217;ve aleady used Ubuntu to convert one of my non-techy friends to Linux and it has worked pretty good. To sum it up: I think Ubuntu is a decent distro, but I maybe wouldn&#8217;t use it on one of my own boxes.</p>
<p>Back to the original topic: I&#8217;m really curious to see how well my girlfriend will get along with her new operating system&#8230; So far it seems she&#8217;ll have a smooth transition. There are free alternatives for all the programs she uses on a regular basis and I found a nice explanation of how to <a href="http://www.plaintivemewling.com/?p=20">share Firefox and Thunderbird profiles on a dual boot system</a> (the link doesn&#8217;t contain anything surprising, but it&#8217;s a nice reference anyway). Additionally I&#8217;m really curious to see how she will like <a href="http://www.gnome.org/"><span class="caps">GNOME</span></a> and if she finds it as user-friendly as I do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week I finally had a little more time to work on Gentoo related things again, so I commited some overdue packages to the tree.</p>
<p>The action started on Tuesday, when I commited the 20+ ebuilds from <a href="http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/">ruby-gnome-0.14.1</a> (mostly version bumps plus a few new packages like <a href="http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?RubyZilla">ruby-gtkmozembed</a>). Quite a lot of users have been waiting for this, as the previous version we had in the tree (0.12.0) didn&#8217;t play nicely with GTK+ 2.8/<span class="caps">GNOME</span> 2.12. This problems are now sorted, so that quite a few bugs could be closed and marked fixed. :)</p>
<p>And then <a href="http://www.gmosx.com/article/2">George released Nitro 0.25.0</a> yesterday, which found its way into the tree only hours later. This has mainly to do with the fact that I already had everything in place from the 0.24.0 release, which I then never commited because George said that there soon will be a release focussed on bug fixes and code clean-up. Apparently this has worked out nicely, so go ahaed, emerge <a href="http://www.nitrohq.com/">Nitro</a> and play around with it, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll like it.</p>
<p>In the evening <a href="http://aglug.net">we</a> had our montly Viennese Gentoo users meetup, which as always was really funny. I came home pretty late and my head still hurts, but it definitely was among the most entertaining evenings in the last few weeks. Thanks guys!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once again I try to avoid doing the things I&#8217;m actually supposed to do, so here&#8217;s another issue of &#8220;citizen428&#8217;s random tidbits&#8221;.<br />
<ul><br />
<li><a href="http://www.principiadiscordia.com/">Principia Discordia</a>: &#8220;<i>How I Found Goddess And What I Did To Her When I Found Her. Wherein is Explained Absolutely Everything Worth Knowing About Absolutely Anything</i>&#8221;. I&#8217;m maybe the last person to find this decent online edition of the Principia, but stuff like this happens when you get abducted by time-travelling dolphins before being right in the middle of a government conspiracy.

<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/nconner23/bwcards.html">1000 Blank White Cards</a>: &#8220;<I>1000 Blank White Cards is a card game, the purpose of which is to create the cards you&#8217;re playing with.</i>&#8221;. Personally I find this really cool: you start out with white cards, and everybody has to draw his or her own cards. I want to try out this game as soon as possible, and I&#8217;ll make sure to tell you about it afterwards&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.writesf.com/">Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy</a>: This guide on writing decent SciFi and Fantasy stories is for free, but the author requested that if you like it, you should tell another aspiring writer about it, and buy two of his books. As I currently don&#8217;t have the money for the latter, I thought I can at least use my blog to reach some more aspiring writers. (via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/03/free_online_sf_writi.html">BoingBoing</a>)</li>

I&#8217;ve been playing around with this for around a week now, and I have to say that I really like it. Don&#8217;t be afraid, <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">why</a> is involved, so there&#8217;s chunky bacon for all!</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just wasted two hours fixing a problem that maybe wasn&#8217;t one to begin with. Don&#8217;t you just love it when software starts acting strange for no obvious reason, and you have nfc what&#8217;s going on? And then suddenly, when you&#8217;re about to finally throw that frigging PC out of the window so you can once and for all start your new career as buddhist mendicant, it just starts working again as if nothing ever happened.</p>
<p>Given that my free time is currently rather limited, I&#8217;m pretty pissed at the moment, as I&#8217;ve tried really hard to have some spare hours this afternoon to spend on some personal projects of mine. Ok, I&#8217;m talking about software projects, and maybe I also would have wasted hours chasing some stupid bug. But at least it would have been <strong>MY</strong> bug, and I would even have considered it to be fun. Strange, eh?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When it comes to Ruby, I&#8217;ve recently mostly been blogging about <a href="http://www.nitrohq.com/">Nitro</a>, which I think will be a really great framework for writing web applications once it matures a little more. For the next version (0.25.0) the developers plan to concentrate on bug fixing, code cleanup and refactoring, as well as documentation. The current development version &#8211; which following my suggestion is now called Glycerin &#8211; can be fetched from a <a href="http://repo.nitrohq.com/">Darcs repository</a>, so there shouldn&#8217;t be anything stopping you from valuable contributions! ;)</p>
<p>Ok, after my usual Nitro evangelism, it&#8217;s time to finally talk about the other excellent web framework Ruby has to offer: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a>. I haven&#8217;t used it for quite some time now, but when I got bored a few days ago, I decided to once again start playing around with it. I&#8217;ve done some googling and found some nice articles, so here&#8217;s my suggested reading list for the aspiring Rails programmer (please note that this list doesn&#8217;t include docs from the official site, because they&#8217;re easy enough to find):</p>

I think it&#8217;s really important to wrap your head around the underlying principles of a framework before you start to use it, so make sure you really understand what Amy&#8217;s trying to tell you.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html">Rolling with Ruby on Rails</a>: Once you got the basic principles, it&#8217;s time to visit <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/">ONLamp</a> to read Curt  Hibbs nice introductory article. It doesn&#8217;t really go into much detail, but I&#8217;m sure it will wet your appetite&#8230;</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.slash7.com/articles/2005/01/24/really-getting-started-in-rails">Really Getting Started in Rails</a>: Now that you&#8217;re rolling with Rails, it&#8217;s time to go back to Amy&#8217;s site. There you&#8217;ll find this nice article that is meant as an addition to the previously mentioned &#8220;Rolling with Ruby on Rails&#8221;, explaining some of the whys and hows Curt had to leave out to keep his text short and to the point.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/03/03/rails.html">Rolling with Ruby on Rails, Part 2</a>: Do you start to see a pattern here? Correct, it&#8217;s Curt&#8217;s turn again. In the second part of his introductory Rails article, he finishes off the cookbook application from the first part, before giving pointers to some of the more interesting features of Rails, like caching, transactions, testing, generators and so on.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://rails.homelinux.org/">Four Days on Rails</a>: Now that you should have a basic understanding of how Rails works, you should definitely check out this excellent <span class="caps">HOWTO</span> by John McCreesh: &#8220;<i>It&#8217;s about 40 pages formatted for double-sided printing on A4, and by the time you&#8217;ve read it, you should have a useful toolbox of Rails techniques and a good idea of where to look on the web for more information</i>&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you take your time to carefully read this stuff, you should be pretty much up to speed in Rails development in less than a week! Don&#8217;t be passive while reading the articles, but start writing you own little app and constantly improve it while you learn. Once you feel comfortable with the basic principles, you can read some of the more advanced stuff, like <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/06/09/rails_ajax.html">Ajax on Rails</a>, <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/11/02/rest-on-rails.html"><span class="caps">REST</span> on Rails</a>, <a href="http://www.slash7.com/articles/2005/08/13/ajaxariffic-autocomplete-with-scriptaculous">Ajaxariffic Autocomplete with Scriptaculous</a>  or the Rails articles <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">why the lucky stuff</a> publishes on <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/">RedHanded</a>. Have fun!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You probably don&#8217;t want to know what I&#8217;ve been up to lately, but mean bastard that I am, I&#8217;m going to tell you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Watched another Chinese movie at the <a href="http://viennale.at/">Viennale</a>, which was called <a href="http://viennale.at/en/programm/filme/1869.shtml">Hong Yan</a>. If you like quiet movies which tell simple stories, this one definitely is a good choice. I liked it quite a lot, so I really recommend you try to see this one!</p>
<p><strong>Thursday:</strong> My girl friend and me had lunch at the <a href="http://www.falter.at/web/wwei/detail.php?nr=5266&amp;ref=(strasse%3Dliechtenstein%26bezirk%3D9%26teil%3D1">Wiener Deewan</a>, which is located in Vienna&#8217;s 9th district. It&#8217;s a nice small restaurant with Indian/Pakistani food, which has a unique concept: All you can eat, pay what you want! Really! They have several  great curries, salad and bread. Quite a lot of dishes are vegetarian, and everything&#8217;s delicious. And although the drinks sell for fixed prices and are not included in the &#8220;pay what you want&#8221;, you get free tap water with the food, so you don&#8217;t feel obliged to order drinks. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daal">dal</a> is fantastic, as are the other vegetarian dishes and the lamb curry. The restaurant itself is small and packed, which together with the intersting mix of people adds up to a nice and relaxed athmosphere. Definitely a good place to go if you are in Vienna and dig Indian food!</p>
<p><strong>Friday:</strong> Football! Went to Parndorf to watch the Sportklub game, which we lost 4:0. Later we collectively tried hard to erase our memories of that game, and I somehow ended up in a strange location I&#8217;ve never been before, watching a Russian/American surf punk band called <a href="http://www.janceewarnick.com/">The Jancee Pornick Casino</a>. Here&#8217;s a little info from their web site: <i>The trio calls their own style Las Vegas-punk and Russian surf, but there are many more ingredients like rockabilly, beat music and even 60&#8217;s elevator music, all being laced with a good jug of good-hearted Russian humor making the Pornick sound so vivid and unique. These are some wild boys but, man, they can also play their instruments!</i> Unfortunately we came rather late and only saw the last few songs, but the gig was pretty cool and I&#8217;ll probably buy one or two of their CDs once I have money again&#8230; (Hint: If you now feel a strange urge to buy me one now, I surely won&#8217;t stop you!)</p>
<p><strong>Saturday:</strong> On Saturday my friend <a href="http://www.cargal.org/drupal/index.php">Steve</a> decided that Salzburg is way too boring, so he came to Vienna to visit museums, meet friends and for generally having a good time. We had food and some beers at the <a href="http://bluebox.at">Blue Box</a>, before moving on to the Xeno, where I finish off a lot of my nights out with a last beer on my way home&#8230; It was a relaxed and nice evening, especially since I hadn&#8217;t seen Steve for quite some time before this.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday:</strong> I&#8217;m sure that like most other days Sunday had a morning and afternoon as well, but I only remember watching TV in the evening and listening to the first episode of Cory Doctorow&#8217;s new podcast, <a href="http://craphound.com/000547.html">When Sysadmins Ruled the World</a>. It&#8217;s really great and I can&#8217;t wait to hear the next episode, so I definitely recommend this to you my fellow geeks and nerds!</p>
<p><strong>Monday:</strong> Went to the <a href="http://www.bigtime.at/">Big Time International Pub</a> where some Austrian <a href="http://pardus.at">Pardus</a> players had a little meetup. All in all there were 8 people, we had some beer, talked a lot about the game and generally had a good time. You still don&#8217;t play Pardus yet? Well, then you certainly should start!</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Nothing special. Did some long overdue university stuff, hung out in the Pardus alliance chat and watched 3sat for the whole day. They have a China special going on, so it&#8217;s 24 hours of documentaries and movies about the &#8220;Middle Kingdom&#8221;. Some of this has been quite interesting, and how often do you get a chance to claim watching TV is related to university?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also played around with some technical stuff and found a really nice project I hardly can wait to tell you about, but I&#8217;ll leave that for another blog. I&#8217;ll now try to find out what happened to the last few hours, because I just noticed it&#8217;s close to 9:30pm already and it only feels like 6:30 or something&#8230; Oh, before I forget it: I added a <a href="http://clustrmaps.com/counter/maps.php?url=http://citizen428.net">ClustrMap</a> to my blog&#8217;s sidebar, so that from now on I can check from where in the world my blog gets read. South America and Africa don&#8217;t seem to be particularly interested in what I write, which makes the kittens sad. And does nobody around here ever think about the children?*</p>
<I>Disclaimer: I neither have children nor kittens, but I didn&#8217;t want to drag Baby Jesus into this mess. If I would he&#8217;d be crying though&#8230;</i></div>
