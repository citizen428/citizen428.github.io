  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lectures seen on day 1:</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1256.de.html"><em>Who can you trust?</em></a><br />
Business as usual: introduction by Tim Pritlove, followed by the keynote. This year&#8217;s speaker was <a href="http://www.eff.org/~barlow/">EFF&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a>, who talked about ethics and responsibility in the hacker community. Quite nice, although I wasn&#8217;t all too fond of the way he encouraged people to police their fellow hackers. But for me the most interesting thing possibly was the confirmation of a Chaos Communication Camp in August 2007!</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1656.de.html"><em>Design and Implementation of an object-oriented, secure <span class="caps">TCP</span>/IP Stack</em></a><br />
Quite interesting and despite Andreas Bogk&#8217;s involvement it didn&#8217;t include too much <a href="http://www.opendylan.org/">Dylan</a> advocacy.</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1461.en.html"><em>The Grim Meathook Future</em></a><br />
Despite not really having a concept, this lecture wasn&#8217;t all bad. The speaker was a quite funny and opinionated guy, as were the people who joined the discussion in the end. Nothing great, but quite entertaining.</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1761.en.html"><em>Dylan Introduction</em></a> <br />
No concept, terrible English, and altogether not really informative &#8211; at least if this wasn&#8217;t your first contact with Dylan.</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1402.en.html"><em>Drones</em></a><br />
My personal highlight for the day: interesting topic, good and funny presentation, motivating people to go out and have fun. That&#8217;s how talks at the <span class="caps">CCC</span> should be.</p>
<p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1537.de.html"><em>Know Your Citizens</em></a><br />
<a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1692.en.html"><em>Hacking the Electoral Law</em></a><br />
<a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1423.en.html"><em>We don&#8217;t trust voting computers</em></a><br />
<a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1555.en.html"><em>Revenge of the Female Nerds</em></a><br />
Since I&#8217;ve been to this talks but haven&#8217;t payed close attention (<span class="caps">IRC</span>, surfing, working on a MySQL problem with berq etc.), I can&#8217;t really say much about them. I picked up the occasional interesting fact, but other than that I don&#8217;t think I really missed much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a mostly sleepless bus journey and &#8220;some&#8221; waiting, we&#8217;ve finally made it to the already quite busy <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Hackcenter">Hackcenter</a>, where we met a few people we know from previous years. About half an hour ago the queue at the ticket counter was way too long, so we&#8217;re trying our luck a little later. Since we&#8217;re getting up quite early tomorrow (around 9am) to see the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1256.en.html">keynote</a>, I&#8217;ll try to catch a few more hours of sleep tonight.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a little less than four hours, <a href="http:berq.net">berq</a>, <a href="http://twoday.tuwien.ac.at/perm">lippi</a>, <a href="http://red667.org">red667</a>, and me will leave for Berlin where we&#8217;re going to attend the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Home">23C3</a>. Since the <a href="http://oebb.at">Ã–BB</a> still sucks, we&#8217;re once again going by bus, arriving tomorrow at around 6:30am. Judging from last year the time between our arrival until we can check into our <a href="http://www.hostels.com/en/availability.php/HostelNumber.10594">hostel</a> at around noon will be spent drinking beer, which definitely isn&#8217;t a recommended breakfast option. Kids, don&#8217;t try this at home!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we&#8217;ll once again have loads of fun, and unlike the last years I plan on regularly blogging and posting pics from the event, so stay tuned! Anyone interested in meeting up at the 23C3 either post a comment here or send a mail to my GMail account.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Jethro Tull, Christmas song</strong></p>
<p>Once in Royal David&#8217;s City<br />
Stood a lonely cattle shed<br />
Where a mother held her baby<br />
You&#8217;d do well to remember the things He later said</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re stuffing yourselves at the Christmas parties<br />
You&#8217;ll just laugh when I tell you to take a running jump<br />
You&#8217;re missing the point I&#8217;m sure does not need making<br />
That Christmas spirit is not what you drink</p>
<p>So how can you laugh when your own mother&#8217;s hungry<br />
And how can you smile when the reasons for smiling are wrong?<br />
And if I just messed up your thoughtless pleasures<br />
Remember, if you wish, this is just a Christmas song</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I&#8217;ve blogged about me being uncertain whether to get myself a Nintento Wii or an Xbox 360 (please don&#8217;t tell me to get both, that thought is too tempting already!). Currently Big N&#8217;s latest offering is a slight favorite again, since &#8211; after an exhausting few days partying &#8211; I spent the late afternoon and early evening playing <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/556/556422p1.html">Paper Mario: The Thounsand-Year Door</a>, which is one of the most entertaining and funny games I&#8217;ve ever played. Later on I decided to finally try out the <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> with Mario Kart DS (friend code: 197655187733), and I have to say that I just love it, which means that now I really have to get myself a copy of <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/697/697307p1.html">Metroid Prime Hunters</a> as soon as possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you may know I&#8217;m a big fan of video game consoles. I currently own two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES"><span class="caps">NES</span></a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNES"><span class="caps">SNES</span></a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Drive">Mega Drive</a>  (aka Genesis), a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playstation">PS1</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Cube">Game Cube</a> and loads of games. I also played quite a lot on the other systems common in Europe (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn">Saturn</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N64">N64</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS2">PS2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox">Xbox</a>). Among the listed systems, the Dreamcast is probably still my favorite for being really innovative and having lots of great games, with the GC coming in a close second. But I&#8217;ve had great times with all of them &#8211; the original Mario Kart on the <span class="caps">SNES</span> and most Square titles on the PS1 come to mind. Of course I also love handhelds and own an original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> (which is unfortunately broken), a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBA"><span class="caps">GBA</span></a> and a black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Lite">Nintendo DS LIte</a>, which <span class="caps">IMHO</span> is the coolest portable gaming system I&#8217;ve ever seen (with honorable mentions for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Nomad">Sega Nomad</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Express">Turbo Express</a>).</p>
<p>As you can see I own everything Nintendo ever made except for the N64, which too had a lot of great games but which I somehow never bought. And I really love their products. But I also was always very fond of Sega&#8217;s systems, and when the company announced that they wouldn&#8217;t produce any more consoles after the DC, I was pretty sure that I won&#8217;t buy another game console ever. That held true for a surprisingly long time, until I got myself a GC at the beginning of this year, because (1) the console fever got me again and (2) it was ridiculously cheap because it was already close to the end of it&#8217;s life cycle. And although I currently hardly take the time to play with the systems I already own, I&#8217;m considering buying a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games_%28seventh_generation_era%29">seventh generation console</a>.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a> vs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3">PS3</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a>. I&#8217;m definitely not going to get myself a PS3. First off I&#8217;m not interested in Blu-ray, <span class="caps">HDMI</span> and the other fancy stuff, and secondly I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Copy_Protection">Sony sucks</a>. Besides that at least two of my friends will get one, so I can play the newest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Evolution_Soccer"><span class="caps">PES</span></a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29"><span class="caps">GTA</span></a> with them. So of course the Wii would be an obvious choice: it has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess">Twilight Princess</a>, is made by Nintendo and features this incredibly cool controller. And did I mention  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess">Twilight Princess</a>? Besides that it offers wireless, the option to play my GC games (I could save a little room by storing the GC someplace else), a cool download feature and I&#8217;m sure there will be interesting possibilities to use it in conjunction with the DS. But yesterday I suddenly realized that I never considered the Xbox 360. None of my friends has one, and nobody mentioned any plans to buy it. So I read up on it a little, and somehow I started to like the system. Sure, it&#8217;s made by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">the big evil company</a> and it doesn&#8217;t exactly offer original games. But it has <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/744/744356p1.html">Gears of War</a>, <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/741/741860p1.html">F.E.A.R</a>, <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/717/717824p1.html">Prey</a> and a lot more good shooters. And I really like playing shooters. Then there&#8217;s <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/698/698400p1.html">Oblivion</a>, which by itself may justify getting a 360. Considering the upcoming <a href="http://halo3.com/">Halo 3</a> and <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/707/707567p1.html">Star Trek Legacy</a>, the system might well be worth its money for me. Plus I&#8217;ve never owned a Microsoft console. Actually I was pretty sure I never will, but since <a href="http://gnulords.org/~colo/">colo</a> mentioned that he&#8217;s interested in a <span class="caps">PSP</span>, I&#8217;m surprised by anything anymore.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m still pondering wether to buy a new console or not, but if I do, I&#8217;m not sure anymore that I will be a Wii.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As always December turns out to be the busiest month of the year: Last Monday I met up with <a href="http://berq.net/">berq</a> and <a href="http://gnulords.org/~colo/misc/quotes.txt">colo</a> for beer, dinner and nerd talk, which I really enjoyed. On Thursday the ominous <a href="http://blingblingsquad.net/">[[:bbs:]]</a> had its Christmas party, which as expected led to loads of consumed alcohol and a headache on the next day. Nonetheless I joined the Viennese <a href="http://www.pardus.at">Pardus</a> meeting on Friday after having dinner with Silvia and a friend of hers. Yesterday <a href="http://www.cargal.org">Steve</a> came to Vienna, so we and some other friends went to have dinner (best Sushi I ever enjoyed outside of Asia) and some drinks afterwards. Since this week&#8217;s schedule didn&#8217;t leave me enough time to attend my Taekwondo classes, I got up after ~6h of sleep this morning to attend the class at 10:00am.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all, as next week will be equally busy: On Wednesday I&#8217;m going to see <a href="http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/">Placebo</a> at the <a href="http://www.stadthalle.com/">Wiener Stadthalle</a>. Yes, that&#8217;s quite different from the rather small punk and hardcore concerts I usually go to, but I somehow like them and want to see if they&#8217;ll live up to their good reputation as a live band. On Thursday yours truly will attend the Christmas party of his former employer, while on Friday my current company will have one. Saturday I&#8217;ll meet up with a friend of mine who&#8217;s visiting from Beijing, while I plan on spending a relaxing day at the spa on Sunday.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell now the week before Christmas will also be full with dinners, parties and other appointments, and the week after that I&#8217;m in Berlin for the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Home">23C3</a>. To cut a long story short: if you&#8217;re interested in a meeting either join me for one of the activities listed above or you&#8217;ll probably have to wait until 2007. Wow, I feel important now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This evening I found some time to work on my blog again, so here&#8217;s a quick rundown of things that changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share and save:</strong> After reading the templates used by <a href="http://s9y.org">Serendipity</a> to get a hang of <a href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a>, I&#8217;ve edited entries.tpl to include a mailto link to share entries, as well as the possibility to digg posts or add them to del.icio.us. There ya go, Web 2.0 lovers.</li>
<li><strong>Feed love:</strong> Syndication rocks, especially when using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> which offers great features like the Link Splicer which automatically creates this &#8220;Links for the day&#8221; entries out of my del.icio.us bookmarks. But since I also got an account on <a href="http://citizen428.suprglu.com/">SuprGlu</a>, I&#8217;ve decided to additionally provide you with the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/citizen428stalker">citizen428stalker</a> feed, which additionally contains my flickr photos, my Plazes traze, info from 43 Things and 43 Places and much more. So if you&#8217;re up for the whole citizen428 package, you might want to give this new feed a try.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On nearly every system I use, my ~/.bashrc calls &#8220;fortune -se&#8221;. When I logged in right now I just got the following:</p>
<p><b>&#8220;You will be successful in love.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into any details, but getting this exact quote today is about as ironic as it gets. Or maybe fortune just has a very strange interpretation of &#8220;succesful&#8221;.</p>
