  <div class="entry-content"><p>This evening I found some time to work on my blog again, so here&#8217;s a quick rundown of things that changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share and save:</strong> After reading the templates used by <a href="http://s9y.org">Serendipity</a> to get a hang of <a href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a>, I&#8217;ve edited entries.tpl to include a mailto link to share entries, as well as the possibility to digg posts or add them to del.icio.us. There ya go, Web 2.0 lovers.</li>
<li><strong>Feed love:</strong> Syndication rocks, especially when using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> which offers great features like the Link Splicer which automatically creates this &#8220;Links for the day&#8221; entries out of my del.icio.us bookmarks. But since I also got an account on <a href="http://citizen428.suprglu.com/">SuprGlu</a>, I&#8217;ve decided to additionally provide you with the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/citizen428stalker">citizen428stalker</a> feed, which additionally contains my flickr photos, my Plazes traze, info from 43 Things and 43 Places and much more. So if you&#8217;re up for the whole citizen428 package, you might want to give this new feed a try.</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&#8217;t come around to do any more <span class="caps">CSS</span> changes yet, but that&#8217;s next on my list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After my two private lessons last week I had my first full Taekwondo training session today. Here&#8217;s what I learned: My overall lifestyle and sports don&#8217;t really mix. Sex, drugs and Rock&#8217;n&#8217;Roll &#8211; unfortunately I&#8217;m doing way better in some categories than in others &#8211; definitely took a beating (pun intended) from martial arts. My lungs declared war on me (damn you cheap Chinese cigarettes!), my pulse was going so fast that I was afraid an 8bit counter might not suffice for counting it and various other parts of my body just seemed very surprised to get used again. But once this painful first 15 minutes were over, the following 50 minutes were actually pretty cool and I&#8217;m looking forward to Thursday&#8217;s session.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After using it for quite a while, I got bored with the old look of my blog and so I started to update it today. Here&#8217;s a quick rundown of things that changed:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><strong>Added various links:</strong> I&#8217;ve updated the sidebar to include links to <a href="http://myspace.com/citizen428">my MySpace profile</a> (resistance really is futile) and <a href="http://citizen428.suprglu.com/">my SuprGlu site</a> (making it easier for you stalkers). I&#8217;ve also readded the links to my profiles on <a href="http://www.43things.com/person/citizen428">43 Things</a> and <a href="http://www.43places.com/person/citizen428">43 Plazes</a>, so it&#8217;s a happy day for all you buzzword loving Web 2.0 fans out there.</li><br />
<li><strong>Advanced syndication:</strong> I got rid of my blog&#8217;s own syndication features in favor of <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/citizen428/">FeedBurner</a>. Why? Because it offers really cool stuff like &#8220;SmartFeeds&#8221; which create the right <span class="caps">RSS</span>/Atom feeds for the reader you use on the fly, &#8220;link slicing&#8221; (a daily entry of links I add to <a href="http://del.icio.us/citizen428">my del.icio.us account</a> gets generated and added to the feed) and the possibility to subscribe to this blog via email. If you are among my true fans who have  subscribed to this site long ago don&#8217;t despair, I&#8217;m 301 redirecting most of the old syndication links to FeedBurner (the <span class="caps">RSS</span> 0.91 feed is used to push data to FeedBurner).</li><br />
<li><strong>More syndication features:</strong> I&#8217;ve signed up for <a href="http://talkr.com">Talkr</a> so you lazy folks have the chance to get this site as a Podcast, without me having to go through the hassle of actually recording one. Nifty, eh? Besides that I get US$ 7 for everyone who signs up to Talkr for at least 30 days, and since Christmas is near that just sounds like the perfect opportunity to make yours truly happy, doesn&#8217;t it? ;) Apart from the Podcast goodness there&#8217;s now also a convenient link to add this site to your <a href="http://del.icio.us/citizen428">Technorati</a> favorites with just a single click of your mouse, which means lazyness finally is no longer an excuse for not doing so.</li><br />
<li><strong>Sidebar reorganization:</strong> Dropped some plugins, added, rearranged and reconfigured some others.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>As you can see I&#8217;ve also changed the theme from my tweaked version of &#8220;Joshua&#8221; to the Serendipity port of &#8220;Modern World&#8221;. I like the overall look of the theme quite a lot, but there are various changes I want to apply to the <span class="caps">CSS</span> as soon as I can be bothered to do so. Until now I&#8217;ve only changed some of the colors, but once I&#8217;m done it would be pretty cool if this site wouldn&#8217;t only look good, but also validate as <span class="caps">XHMTL</span>. I&#8217;m also in need of a logo sized 220&#215;128 pixels, so if you&#8217;re feeling creative and want to surprise me, send your work of art to my Gmail address. Once I finally take over leadership of the world, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be pretty happy to say &#8220;I did the logo for this guy&#8217;s website&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I started my new job this January, I more or less stopped doing any sports, which had the usual consequences of fitness&#8212;&nbsp;&amp;&amp; weight++. I&#8217;ve wanted to change this for quite a while now and since my local <a href="http://www.taekwondo-twin-center.at/home.php?ttc_schule_id=8">Taekwondo school</a> &#8211; which by the way is conviniently located half-way between my apartment and the office &#8211; currently has a special offer (two private introductory lessons plus the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobok">dobok</a> for 25 Euro) I decided to give it a go. The first intro lesson today was pretty cool and the second will be this Wednesday. After this I&#8217;ll get my white belt and will formally start training in the beginner&#8217;s class.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b><br />
Had my second private lesson on Wednesday and really liked it too, so I signed up for the school and will try to train 2-3 times a week from now on. Since there are 13(!) training sessions per week I can choose from, I should be able to squeeze them in even in rather busy weeks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;some random stuff I wanted to blog about for quite some time already:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pearl Jam concert (September 25th@Wiener Stadthalle):</strong> I have to admit that I&#8217;m not the biggest <a href="http://pearljam.com/">PJ</a> fan, but since Silvia was nice enough to invite me (thanks by the way!), I went to see one of the best concerts in a long time! The band and the atmosphere was great and I was quite surprised to see the traditionally rather lame crowd in Vienna so excited! (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/citizen428/sets/72157594302284739">pics@flickr</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Internet Explorer on Linux:</strong> As we all know, IE sucks donkey balls. But some sites who don&#8217;t care about standards &#8211; and whose developers definitely should be first against the wall when the revolution comes &#8211; only work with Microsoft&#8217;s browser. But don&#8217;t despair, help is available in form of <a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page">IEs4Linux</a>, a shellscript which downloads IE and automatically configures Wine for it. Flash 9 is also included and if you really insist on it, you can run 3 different versions of IE at the same time (5, 5.5 and 6), which is pretty handy for web developers. I have IE6 installed on my Kubuntu system for quite a while now, and in the rare cases I really need it, it works like a charm.</li>
<li><strong>Pokerstars client on Linux:</strong> Most online Poker sites don&#8217;t seem to be interested in Linux users, since the clients they offer are mostly only available for Windows. Some of them at least offer Java clients, but with my general dislike for most things Java and my strong preference of <a href="http://www.pokerstars.com/">Pokerstars</a> over other Poker sites, I gave the client a shot under Wine and was really pleased to find out that it just works&#8482;. Of course it would be much nicer to have a native client, but for the time being I&#8217;m happy enough with this workaround.</li>
<li><strong><span class="caps">UEFA</span> cup Pasching vs. Livorno@Pasching:</strong> Went with some other Sportclub fans to see the <span class="caps">UEFA</span> cup match Pasching vs. Livorno in Pasching. It was a great day, and I still laugh my ass off when I think about the policemen and -women who found our little group of around 25 people rooting for the away team  (as Austrian you were only able to buy tickets for the home sectors) so frightening, that they not only surrounded us for the whole match, but even put on their riot gear. And there I was, thinking every policeman in Austria already knows that we are only dangerous to ourselves. ;)</li>
<li><strong>man pages:</strong> Read them! You know you should! Even if you believe you know an application. E.g.: &#8220;man sshd&#8221;, section &#8220;AUTHORIZED_KEYS <span class="caps">FILE</span> <span class="caps">FORMAT</span>&#8221;. Or am I really the only person who didn&#8217;t know about all the useful options like &#8220;from&#8221;, &#8220;command&#8221;, &#8220;no-port-forwarding&#8221;, &#8220;no-pty&#8221; etc.?<br />
<br />
<li><strong>Mac stuff:</strong> Here&#8217;s some cool widgets and plugins which make the OS X experience even nicer: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/WebObjects/FileSharing.woa/wa/iTunesShut.zip.zip?a=downloadFile&amp;user=gugulino1&amp;path=.Public/iTunesShut.zip">iTunesShut</a>, <a href="http://www.corsofamily.net/jcorso/vi/">VI Input Manager</a>, <a href="http://www.dashboardwidgets.com/showcase/details.php?wid=1510">Application Update Widget</a> (thanks Moose!), <a href="http://hayne.net/MacDev/Ash/">AppleScript Shell</a>, <a href="http://www.dougscripts.com/itunes/index.php">Doug&#8217;s AppleScripts for iTunes</a></ul>
<p><br />
Last but not least here are some funny/interesting things I found over the past few weeks:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><a href="http://www.malevole.com/mv/misc/killerquiz">Programming Language Inventor or Serial Killer</a> (via <a href="http://metalab.at/wiki/Hauptseite">metalab-members</a>)</li></p>
<li><strong>Robot chicken:</strong> Great stop motion animation. Examples: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2660802447916665129&amp;q=robot+chicken">1</a>, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4651757054772769361&amp;q=robot+chicken">2</a>, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5395083952125133994&amp;q=robot+chicken">3</a> (thanks <a href="http://gnulords.org/~colo/serendipity/">colo</a>!)</li>
<li><a href="http://elpj.com/"><span class="caps">ELP</span> Laser Turntable</a>: <a href="http://bonki.net/blog/">bonki</a> posted this a while back, but I never came around to post it here.</li>
<li><a href="http://geekz.co.uk/schneierfacts/fact/128">Bruce Schreier facts</a>: &#8216;cause Chuck Norris isn&#8217;t as cool as Bruce! And as we all know: Bruce Schneier tapdances in Morse Code. (via <a href="http://berq.net/">berq</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/robots/china-makes-a-sexy-slutty-robot-210802.php">China Makes a Sexy, Slutty Robot</a>: What can I say&#8230; (thanks <a href="http://www.leyrer.priv.at/martin/">m3</a>)</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Because of me visiting some friends in China (Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing to be a little more specific) from October 5th to 25th, this site hasn&#8217;t seen any recent updates. Of course I do have a lot to tell about the trip, and there&#8217;s a plethora of other stuff I want to blog about since about late September. But this won&#8217;t happen today, since it&#8217;s Sunday and I&#8217;m even more lazy than usual. I still use jet lag as an excuse, but in fact that&#8217;s a blatant lie.</p>
<p>Since waking up at noon all I did was eating, watching 4 episodes of Family Guy, a few South Park specials like <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/1087487">Park Wars</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=d8k0xV3XpFU">Fatrix</a> and other stuff, as well as writing some mails and chatting with friends. Oh, I also watched the newest <a href="http://www.happyslip.com/">Happyslip</a> videos on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=HappySlip">YouTube</a> and they are funny as always.</p>
<p>Later tonight I&#8217;ll watch a few more episodes of season 4 of The Sopranos before playing a tournament or two on <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/682/682539p1.html">True Swing Golf</a> (I bought both the <span class="caps">DVD</span> box and the game on Friday).</p>
<p>Bottom line: being lazy and adding some random noise to the blogosphere was just what I needed today, so you&#8217;ll have to wait a little longer for the other stuff to finally appear on this site.</p>
<p>Oh, and before I forget it, starting from December I&#8217;ll only work 25h/week so I can finally pick up my studies again. Besides that I hope that spending less time at this forsaken place called office will significantly better my mood, otherwise I might as well get myself an Alcoholics Anonymous subscription sooner than later&#8230; ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the last few weeks the ongoing struggle between good (aka going out to party) and evil (aka work) has led to a severe lack of sleep and a general feeling of exhaustion. That&#8217;s why yesterday evening I only had some running sushi with friends and a few beers afterwards, before returning home before midnight. But instead of going to bed immediately, I made the fatal mistake of visiting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> to watch the videos <a href="http://www.cargal.org">Lotussteve</a>, <a href="http://www.leyrer.priv.at/martin/">m3</a> and <a href="http://red667.org/">Red</a> have recommended. Here are some of my favorites, thanks guys!<br />
<ul><br />
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3IwiynxE3A">Live Super Mario Bros.</a> &#8211; A bunch of high school students doing a rendition of Super Mario Bros. Great stuff and very funny.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYiDo0DjSk">The Internet Is A Series of Tubes</a> &#8211; <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml">The Daily Show&#8217;s</a> Jon Stewart explains how the internet works. You shouldn&#8217;t miss that one!</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVXNL4n73-E">New Super Mario Bros. Final Castle 105 seconds World Record</a> &#8211; Amazing!</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpYgNz6W6Gs">PS3 vs. Wii</a> &#8211; I&#8217;m intending to buy a Wii anyway, but this video is just hilarious.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZtmrunVXs4">Almost &#8211; Cheese &amp; Crackers</a> &#8211; Coolest miniramp skate session ever. Read my lips: <span class="caps">EVER</span>!</li></p>
</ul>
<p>When I finished watching the stuff my friends had recommended, I started browsing around the site and found the following gem I immediately subscribed to:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=HappySlip">Happy Slip Productions</a> &#8211; A Filipina actress who is doing some seriously funny stuff.</p>
<p>After I freed myself from the black hole that YouTube is for one&#8217;s free time, I decided to finally watch <a href="http://orange.blender.org/">Elephants Dream</a>, an animated movie realized entirely with free software, which I downloaded a few weeks ago but never had time to watch before. It&#8217;s really great and of course CC licensed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After running a <a href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor</a> server for more than half a year already and having donated some money to support Tor&#8217;s development, I was looking for new ways to help out the project. That&#8217;s why I decided to set up a mirror, which can be reached <a href="http://tor.blingblingsquad.net">here</a> (<a href="http://tor.blingblingsquad.net">dist/ mirror</a>). The initial sync is still running, but the site should be fully functional soon. Once this is finished, I&#8217;ll also try to set up another mirror on the Vienna based server hosting this domain.</p>
