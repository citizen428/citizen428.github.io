  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Movie:</strong><br />
It&#8217;s October, which means that movie enthusiasts in Vienna can watch loads of good movies at the <a href="http://viennale.at">Vienna International Film Festival (Viennale)</a>:. This year I unfortunately only have time to watch 2 movies, whereas normally it&#8217;s around 5-8&#8230; Yesterday evening we&#8217;ve been watching <a href="http://viennale.at/en/programm/filme/1846.shtml">Alian</a> and tomorrow we will see <a href="http://viennale.at/en/programm/filme/1869.shtml">Hong yan</a>.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s there to say about Alian? It&#8217;s a movie by young Chinese director Wei Xueqi, which portraits two young couples in Guandong&#8217;s Perl River delta. He chose to go for a Dogma like style, only using a DV hand-camera, no make-up and no artificial lighting. All the directors were amateurs and quite a lot of the dialogues were improvised. All this adds together to the feeling of watching a documentary, which summons an image of modern China which is pretty congruent with my experiences from living there for a year. And that&#8217;s probably the main reason why one should go and watch Alian, despite the not really enthralling plot: it draws a good image of the people who don&#8217;t really profit from recent economic developments in China, namely rural workers who come to the booming cities in search for a better life, and who, more often than not, won&#8217;t find it. After the movie there was a little Q&amp;A session with the director, which wasn&#8217;t bad, but also not overly interesting, especially since the translator seemed a little nervous, which led to some strange translations in both directions.</p>
<p><strong>Podcast:</strong><br />
Most of you probably know writer <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> from <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>. If you are a fan of his fiction, you may be delighted to hear that Cory now has finished the first 9 episodes of his new podcast, where he <a href="http://www.craphound.com/podcast.php">reads the story &#8216;After the Siege&#8217;</a>, which he wrote in chunks of 2-5000 words on long-haul flight segments. I&#8217;ve listened to the first 3 readings after I came home from the cinema yesterday, but unfortunately at 2:something a.m. my body decided to surrender to sleep, while my mind actually would have loved to hear more of Cory&#8217;s story. Go check it out, it&#8217;s pretty interesting as far as I&#8217;ve heard it!</p>
<p><strong>Article:</strong><br />
Today I&#8217;ve read an article called <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html">&#8216;What business can learn from Open Source&#8217;</a> by Paul Graham which <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~spb/">spb</a> posted to the alt@gentoo.org alias in a recent discussion. I&#8217;m pretty sure though that this article has been around for quite some time now and I should probably have read it long ago, but better late than never. I think it&#8217;s a pretty good read, and judging from previous work experience it contains a lot of truth, especially on the &#8220;faking to be busy&#8221; part.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;but as I really don&#8217;t want to, I thought I might as well entertain my readers with some nice links. Ready, steady, go!<br />
<ul><br />
<li> <a href="http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20051006/news/news1.html">HAIR&#8217; IS <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">HAT</span></a>: Nothing special to see here, just your regular Jamaican barber who is styling his hair to look like a hat for more than 20 years already. &#8220;A di policeman have to tell him seh is mi hair. Him congratulate mi an&#8217; tell mi seh mi have talent&#8221;. Word! (blame <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/07/man_fashions_his_hai.html">BoingBoing</a>) </li></p>
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patois">Yuh did a expect flood ar yuh tek yuh measurement inna wata?</a>: Ever wondered what mister barber from the article linked above is trying to tell you? Then you definitely should try to <a href="http://jamaicans.com/speakja/index.htm">learn some Patois</a>! </li>
<li> <a href="http://tango-project.org/Tango_Desktop_Project">Tango Desktop Project</a>: Wouldn&#8217;t you just love a consistent user experience for free software GUIs? The guys from the Tango Project sure would, so they&#8217;re putting a lot of effort into style guidelines, a basic icon library and an icon naming spec. Mi likey! (via  <a href="http://gnomedesktop.org/node/2425">Footnotes</a>)</li>
<li> &#8220;BoingBoing &#8211; resistance is futile&#8221;: They just have too many cool links: <a href="http://www.geekonstun.com/mt/archives/marios_64_100405.html">Super Mario in 64 costumes</a>, <a href="http://www.mundonu.com/batmobile1966/">the 1966 Batmobile paper craft</a> or <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/incredible/octopus/octopus1.html">how to build your own Dr. Octopus costume</a>. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.iisg.nl/~landsberger/">Stefan Landsberger&#8217;s Chinese Propaganda Poster Pages</a>: I admit it, I just love communist propaganda posters. Have a look at this really nice collection, and if you happen to have some related links, please send them my way, thanks!</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>: Not too long ago I found this interesting project, which defines itself as &#8220;a reusable non-linear personal web notebook&#8221; and &#8220;an experimental MicroContent WikiWikiWeb built by Jeremy Ruston. It&#8217;s written in <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and JavaScript to run on any modern browser without needing any ServerSide logic&#8221;. Nifty, eh? Funny enough just a little earlier today someone posted to the <a href="http://www.beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/">Tomboy</a> mailing list, asking if anyone&#8217;s working on a way to transfer data to and from TiddlyWiki, which I personally think is a rather cool idea.</li>
<li> <a href="http://raketa.at/index.php?id=4603">HC Hinterseer</a>: Ok, this is only funny for my Austrian readers, but given that today there are elections taking place in Vienna, you should have a look at the great photoshop tutorial <a href="http://raketa.at/">raketa.at</a> has to offer&#8230;</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,380238,00.html">Bibi Blocksberg and Benjamin Bluemchen are Anarchists!</a>: You don&#8217;t believe me? Than have a look at this interview (in German) that news magazine &#8220;Der Spiegel&#8221; featured some days ago. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.anarchism.net/">Anarchism</a>: Now that I&#8217;ve started talking about this topic, I might as well give you some other links from my collection&#8230; <a href="http://www.anarchistblackcross.org/">Anarchist Black Cross</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/">Anarchist <span class="caps">FAQ</span></a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism">Wikipedia on Anarchism</a>, <a href="http://www.socialanarchism.org/">Social Anarchism</a> and an interview with Noam Chomsky on <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/rbr/noamrbr2.html">Anarchism, Marxism &amp; Hope for the Future</a>. Please note that I&#8217;m not trying to encourage anyone to change his political mindset. As long as you&#8217;re open-minded and use your brain,  I can live with most world-views&#8230;</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.huk.org/e/bible-literally-laura.htm">Taking the Bible literally</a>: Talking about being open-minded: &#8220;<i>The radio talk show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger is well known in the <span class="caps">USA</span>. She said that her opposition to homosexuality is firmly grounded in biblical law, namely Leviticus 18:22</i>&#8221;. I think this humorous open letter is quite a good way to deal with religious fundamentalists like Dr. Schlessinger. Thank god I&#8217;m not religious&#8230; ;)(<a href="http://www.huk.org/aktuell/bibelzitate-woertlich.htm">German translation</a>). <b>Edit: Hmpf, only minutes after I post this, I find a forums discussion which suggests that the whole letter may be a hoax.

<li> <a href="http://www.soyouwanna.com/">So you wanna&#8230;</a>: Today I was googling for some information on the <a href="http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/toptens/languages/languages.html">top ten most widely spoken languages in the world</a> and ended up on <a href="http://www.soyouwanna.com/">SoYouWanna</a>, a site I instantly fell in love with. Why? Because according to the site&#8217;s self definition, it&#8217;s all about &#8220;<i>teach[ing] you how to do all the things nobody taught you in school</i>&#8221;. Given that I consider the greater part of my formal education a complete waste of time (and university is only slightly better), I immediately started reading up on lots of topics, and soon found out that the various articles aren&#8217;t only well written, they are pretty funny too! Now go and learn everything you ever wanted to know about <a href="http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/fakeart/fakeart.html">faking an appreciation for art</a>, <a href="http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/irishaccent/irishaccent.html">speaking with an Irish accent</a>, <a href="http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/hangover/hangover.html">curing a hangover</a> or <a href="http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/sushi/sushi.html">enjoying sushi</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>In my current mood I could go on posting links forever, but if I really did that, I wouldn&#8217;t have enough to blog about the next time I don&#8217;t want to prepare for classes&#8230;</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to admit that I was really sceptical when this whole blogging thing started a few years back, mostly because I had the feeling that this will only add to all the noise that already makes finding information on the web harder than it needs to be. However, as time moved on and the blogging scene developed, I really came to appreciate this form of communication. Blogs are not only a great way to keep people updated on what you&#8217;re currently up to (or to stalk other people for that matter), comments and the possibility of trackbacks also provide great facilities for interesting discussions with a wide variety of people and their differing opinions, especially when aggregators like <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> and <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet</a> come into play&#8230;</p>
<p>Why am I writing this today? Well, not long ago <a href="http://citizen428.net/archives/227-Hits-galore.html">I&#8217;ve blogged about my favourite music</a> and mentioned the band &#8220;Ninja High School&#8221;. And then yesterday I get an email from band member Gregory Collins, telling me that he  appreciates I&#8217;ve been writing about them and that they are big Linux geeks themselves. Or do you remember that <a href="http://citizen428.net/archives/204-Dawn-of-the-Dead,-Ruby-Monday,-Doc-FreeBSD.html">blog</a> where I was really surprised that jabber4r got resurrected? Jabber&#8217;s very own &#8220;patron saint&#8221; <a href="http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/">Peter Saint-Andre</a> chipped in to tell me about netxmpp-ruby. And then there is all this other valuable input by people like RL friend <a href="http://www.leyrer.priv.at/martin">Martin &#8216;m3&#8217; Leyrer</a> or Gentoo Universe reader <a href="http://cokehabit.homelinux.org/">George Prowse</a>, whom I&#8217;ve never met in person but who seems to have taken a certain interest in what I&#8217;m writing.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s exactly why I just love having a blog that gets aggregated by <a href="http://planet.gentoo.org/">Planet Gentoo</a> and <a href="http://planet.gentoo.org/universe/">Gentoo Universe</a>: it gives my random musings a greater audience, which quite often leads to interesting comments or trackbacks I wouldn&#8217;t haven gotten otherwise. So thanks to everyone who made this possible, and even more thanks to all the people who care enough to read what I write and help me learn about other views and perspectives by posting comments! :)<u></u></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&#8217;m listening to a lot of music, I thought it may be a nice idea to periodically post my favourite songs.</p>
<p>#5: <a href="http://www.againstme.net/">Against Me!</a> &#8211; &#8220;Baby, I&#8217;m an Anarchist!&#8221;: Taken from their great album &#8220;Reinventing Axl Rose&#8221;, this song is the quintessence of why Against Me! are one of the greatest bands I&#8217;ve ever seen live: energetic and sometimes angry folk punk with great lyrics, that just makes you raise your fists in the air and sing along.</p>
<p>#4: <a href="http://www.wolfgangambros.at/">Wolfgang Ambros</a> &#8211; &#8220;Die Kinettn wo i schlof&#8221;: Recently I&#8217;ve been listening to a lot of Wolfgang Ambros, and I have to say that the music he recorded during the 1970s and early 1980s is defintely among the best music with German (actually Austrian dialect) lyrics I&#8217;ve ever heard. If you like Wolfgang&#8217;s music as much as I do, you probably should also check out the <span class="caps">DVD</span> <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006J9RG/qid=1129453736/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl/028-8208621-3236532">Hoffnungslos selbstbewusst</a>.</p>
<p>#3: <a href="http://www.gogolbordello.com/">Gogol Bordello</a> &#8211; &#8220;Start Wearing Purple&#8221;: Once <a href="http://indiekids.org/2004/04/13/drink-locally-fck-globally/">described as</a> &#8220;Psychopathic Ukrainian Gypsy immigrant folk punk rock&#8221;, one immediately knows why Gogol Bordello and their album &#8220;Gipsy Punks&#8221; are as great as they are.</p>
<p>#2: <a href="http://www.timfite.com/">Tim Fite</a> &#8211; &#8220;Away From The Snakes&#8221;: <a href="http://indiekids.org/">Teaching The Indie Kids To Dance Again</a> described this song in the following way: &#8220;This is every stereotype of country music you&#8217;ve ever heard done right. Music for a whiskey soaked night on the plain with a guitar, drifting to nowhere, but desperate to get away, from cheating wives, lying thieves, and generally being shit on&#8221;. Great stuff, you should check out the full album called &#8220;Gone Ain&#8217;t Gone&#8221;!</p>
<p>#1: <a href="http://www.ninjahighschool.info/">Ninja High School</a> &#8211; &#8220;It&#8217;s alright to fight&#8221;: What can be better than a band that describes its own music as &#8220;positive hardcore dance-rap&#8221;? Not much, that&#8217;s for sure! At least I&#8217;m completely hooked on their style and am really waiting for their new album &#8220;Young Adults Against Suicide&#8221;.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a> had an <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/06/mark_dery_on_the_net.html">article</a> on the first international conference on netporn criticism. They quoted <a href="http://www.markdery.com/archives/news/index.html#000048">Mark Dery&#8217;s keynote</a>, where I read this paragraph that really got me thinking:</p>
<p><i>Can we be far from the future foretold by J.G. Ballard, where car-crash enthusiasts get off on vehicular manslaughter and fans of Space Age snuff thrill to footage of astronauts being roasted alive during re-entry? In the introduction to his 1974 novel Crash, Ballard wondered if the android numbness induced by media bombardment &#8211; the &#8220;demise of feeling&#8221; &#8211; would open the door to &#8220;all our most real and tender pleasures &#8211; in the excitements of pain and mutilation; in sex as the perfect arena&#8230;for&#8230;our&#8230;perversions; in our moral freedom to pursue our own psychopathology as a game.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This strangely reminded me of a lot of stuff I have read during the last year. For one there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.houellebecq.info/english.php3">Michel Houellebecq&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Les Particules élémentaires&#8221; (English: &#8220;The Elementary Particles&#8221;, German: &#8220;Elementarteilchen&#8221;), where somewhere in the middle of the book a character (David di Meola) gets introduced, who has sex and violence mixed up in the most shocking ways one can imagine. This is presented as a logical and inevitable process, which is the consequence of the destruction of old moral values in the 50ies, 60ies and 70ies: Once this liberation gave people the freedom to satisfy all their sexual needs, they went on to satisfy their more basic and gruel phantasies. And suddenly, Charles Manson isn&#8217;t a shocking counterpoint to the Hippie movement, but its logical consequence&#8230;</p>
<p>Reading how Houellebecq describes the content of the snuff videos the aforementioned character produces, one instinctly also has to think about Pasolini&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/4/salo.html">Salo</a>. Shortly after the first pictures of Abu Graibh surfaced, I read a commentary that compared the aesthetics of those pictures to the one which can be found in Pasolini&#8217;s movie (if only I could find that link again). And when you now think about how this whole incident was covered in the media, don&#8217;t you also have a feeling that there was  a strange urge to go into the most unpleasant details and show as much gruel photos as possible? Sometimes I&#8217;m almost convinced that TV news have become a convenient way to sublimely satisfy the darker parts of our own desires.</p>
<p>And then, when I read some texts about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory">critical theory</a>, I found this paragraph about how we as a society are constantly trying to rationalize things in order to get rid of old myths, a process in which enlightenment itself becomes the ultimate myth. This dialectic between overcoming old structures only to rebuild them in what we perceive as more rational, really makes me wonder if we as a society are only doing this in order to find explanations that allow us to follow the desires of our more primitive selves in a way that makes more sense in contemporary society. Do we even want to evolve? Or are we only looking for excuses for not doing so?<br />
<hr><br />
P.S. Sorry for this pretty unorderly rant, I&#8217;m just in a strange mood today and hoped that writing may help. This apparently didn&#8217;t work out&#8230;</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, time for another random link dump. I&#8217;d bet you&#8217;ve been waiting for that, haven&#8217;t you?</p>

<li><a href="http://blog.red667.org/">blog.red667.org</a>: My friend Red started blogging, so I thought I&#8217;ll put some pressure on him by giving his site some exposure. Now he just has to write more&#8230;</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, it&#8217;s time for a little update again, so let&#8217;s sum up the last week and a half, shall we?</p>
<p>On Friday the 16th I went to Neusiedl with some friends. We arrived at the camping site in the afternoon and had some drinks before going to watch the football match between the <a href="http://www.wienersportklub.at/web/servlet/Start">Wiener Sportklub</a> and <a href="http://www.scneusiedl.at/">Neusiedl SC</a>. We won that game 2-1 and I can&#8217;t remember when was the last time we celebrated a goal as much as we did celebrate the winning goal in this game. Later on we went to see a concert of Austrian Ska band <a href="http://www.noheadonmyshoulders.com/">No Head on my Shoulders</a> in the surprisingly nice <a href="http://www.bergwerk-neusiedl.at/">Bergwerk Neusiedl</a>. The gig was great, and to my surprise the guy playing the guitar is an old friend of mine whom I haven&#8217;t seen for years. It&#8217;s also worth to note that <a href="http://www.np03.com/">our friends from Tyrol</a> joined us for the weekend, which maybe explains why the partying continued into the wee hours and my memories are a  little vague&#8230; And it&#8217;s probably also the reason why we spent the greater part of Saturday hanging around and doing nothing, except for a little shopping trip to the outlet center in Parndorf. In the evening we then proceeded to watch the game of Wacker Innsbruck (yes, that&#8217;s the way the team should be called) against Mattersburg in terrible rain. I&#8217;ve seen many football games under bad weather conditions, but this match definitely is among the worst, especially given that it ended 0-0.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Currently I don&#8217;t have that much time for Gentoo stuff, so things are going rather slowly on my end of things. At least I managed to do a version bump of <a href="http://ruby-pdf.rubyforge.org/pdf-writer/index.html">pdf-writer</a> and to finally commit the ebuilds for <a href="http://nitrohq.com">Nitro</a> 0.23.0 that were sitting in my overlay for some time now.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ve been a good boy and submitted patches for the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/mysql-upgrading.xml">MySQL upgrade guide</a> and the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-freebsd.xml">Gentoo/FreeBSD documentation</a>. I&#8217;m sure the great folks from the docs team will commit them soon for your reading pleasure. There also was a little update to the unofficial <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~citizen428/doc/gentoo-netbsd.html">Gentoo/NetBSD doc</a>, so now there&#8217;s really no excuse for not helping <a href="http://thunder.netbsd.edu.pl/">Damian</a> anymore.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you haven&#8217;t tried out <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eselect/index.xml">eselect</a> yet, you definitely should do so! Especially if you maintain one of the current foo-config and update-bar tools please consider converting it to an eselect module, to offer our users the benefits of a  consistent and flexible framework, which additionally also has the advantage of fully supporting $<span class="caps">ROOT</span>. Also there&#8217;s good documentation for <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eselect/user-guide.xml">users</a> and <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eselect/dev-guide.xml">developers</a>, so you won&#8217;t have any problems getting started. That said, I&#8217;ve written a replacement for ruby-config that <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~kugelfang/">Danny</a> will commit pretty soon, so expect to see it in the next release of eselect.</p>
<p>There also have been some small updates to the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-freebsd.xml">Gentoo/FreeBSD installation instructions</a>, and thanks to <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~cardoe/">Cardoe&#8217;s</a> input I&#8217;ve already done another patch that soon will be commited by one of our docs team&#8217;s members.</p>
<p>Last but not least I&#8217;ve written up a short guide for migrating from MySQL 4.0.x to 4.1.x which can be found <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~citizen428/mysql-update.txt">here</a>. It&#8217;s just plain text and based on Francesco&#8217;s mail, but he didn&#8217;t want to write something up himself. It was done late yesterday evening when I was really tired, but it&#8217;s better than nothing and we have a link to give out to our users.</p></div>
