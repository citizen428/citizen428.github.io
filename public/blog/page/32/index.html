  <div class="entry-content"><p>After running a <a href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor</a> server for more than half a year already and having donated some money to support Tor&#8217;s development, I was looking for new ways to help out the project. That&#8217;s why I decided to set up a mirror, which can be reached <a href="http://tor.blingblingsquad.net">here</a> (<a href="http://tor.blingblingsquad.net">dist/ mirror</a>). The initial sync is still running, but the site should be fully functional soon. Once this is finished, I&#8217;ll also try to set up another mirror on the Vienna based server hosting this domain.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I was pretty busy with personal stuff during the last few days, I hadn&#8217;t noticed that two days ago German authorities started confiscating <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a> middleman servers. That changed when earlier today I received an email from the owner of a confiscated system, who wants to get in touch with other Tor admins, in order to start a kind of &#8220;Knowledge Base&#8221; for people who were affected by the recent confiscations or who (still) want to set up their own Tor server. Since I&#8217;m also running <a href="http://serifos.eecs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/desc.pl?q=blingblingserver">such a baby</a> (which never was an exit node though) on a virtual server in Germany, I&#8217;m of course interested in this recent development, so I want to share the informative links provided in his mail with you.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, child pornography is one of the worst crimes I can think of, and I wish the German authorities all the best in finding the people they are after. I do however feel that the route taken here wasn&#8217;t ideal, as it may well lead to a negative perception of Tor in the general public.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve tripled the total amount of traffic Tor is allowed to serve on my system and <a href="http://tor.eff.org/donate.html.en">donated some money</a> to the project. I would advise you to do the same! Besides that I also encourage you to use Tor and promote it to other people, because anonymity is something that can&#8217;t be gained, only lost.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I spent a great evening playing Texas Hold&#8217;em with some friends. Sure, I&#8217;ve lost some money, but it wasn&#8217;t much and I was prepared for that anyway. I could have stopped after I won some nice pots, but netting a profit definitly didn&#8217;t seem to be on my agenda yesterday. Instead I thought a lot about the game and came to conclude the following.</p>
<ul>
	<li style="padding-right:1em;">Relax and look forward, things will get a lot easier that way.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li style="padding-right:1em;">Most things in life depend on luck. However, it&#8217;s up to you how you deal with it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li style="padding-right:1em;">Don&#8217;t get cocky if you&#8217;re succesful, otherwise you&#8217;ll most probably fall hard.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li style="padding-right:1em;">Being unpredictable really may pay off in tense situations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li style="padding-right:1em;">You have to take risks if you want to win big. And you&#8217;ll never really feel the rush of winning if you didn&#8217;t take the risk to lose in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li style="padding-right:1em;">You don&#8217;t really have to be good. The others just need to believe you are.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li style="padding-right:1em;">Money attracts more money. Gambling is easy if loosing doesn&#8217;t hurt.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had a lot more of this, but I guess by now you get what I&#8217;m aiming at: Better to have loved and lost, than never loved at all. Am I still talking about Poker? I guess so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As my PR manager told me, large numbers of fans have already complained about the recent lack of updates. Since I&#8217;m only my reader&#8217;s humble servant, I of course have to comply with this wishes, so here are the long awaited news about yours truly:</p>
<p><strong>Gentoo:</strong><br />
After being a <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> developer for 2 years, I finally decided to leave the project. Since I haven&#8217;t really been active for the past 4 month anyway for several reasons (e.g. work), this was long overdue anyway. I&#8217;ve met a lot of nice and interesting people in the Gentoo community and working with you guys has really been a pleasure! Thanks for that, I really appreciate what I have learned from all of you during that time!</p>
<p><strong>Mac:</strong><br />
Today I&#8217;ve joined the team of <a href="http://opensourcemac.de/">Open.Source.Mac</a> and have already published <a href="http://www.opensourcemac.de/2006/08/12/machtgeil/">my first little article</a> on the site. Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Personal:</strong><br />
On the 2nd of August I celebrated my 27th birthday at <a href="http://www.xeno.co.at/">Xeno</a>. A lot of <a href="http://red667.org/">friends</a> showed up, whereas <a href="http://berq.net/">certain people</a> decided to get drunk somewhere else and then blamed innocent squirrels for their not showing up. It was a cool evening which I really enjoyed, but working on the next day didn&#8217;t exactly qualify as a good cure against the headaches&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Capitalism:</strong><br />
I have to admit that I love portable consoles, especially when they are as sexy as the black Nintendo DS Lite I bought three weeks ago. So far I own <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/643/643656p1.html">Advance Wars: Dual Strike</a>, <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/702/702057p1.html">Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day</a>, <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/567/567496p1.html">Feel The Magic XY/XX</a> and <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/655/655830p1.html">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a>. All of them are really great and I can hardly wait until my copy of <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/666/666125p1.html">Mario Kart DS</a> finally arrives.</p>
<p>I also got myself a nice <a href="http://www.macpower.com.tw/products/hdd3/m9/m9dx">M9 DX enclosure</a> with a 250GB Samsung HD as a backup disk for the Mac Mini. Overall it&#8217;s pretty neat, although it could match the color of the Mini a little better.</p>
<p><strong>Misc</strong><br />
Found an <a href="http://www.explosm.net/articles/6135/4/">article</a> about <a href="http://www.habbohotel.co.uk/">Habbo Hotel</a> on the <a href="http://www.pardus.at">Pardus</a> forums and just had <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/citizen428/sets/72157594226374139/">to try it out</a>. Like the author of the article I most likely won&#8217;t visit the site again, but I had a lot of fun during the hour I spent there.</p>
<p><a href="http://teemow.com">teemow</a> recently blogged about <a href="http://honeybrown.ca/Pubs/BumpTop.html">BumpTop</a>, a new take at the desktop metaphor we all grew used to. The video is quite impressive and I&#8217;d really like to try out such an interface myself, as I&#8217;m interested in how well it works for everyday usage.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always found Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Mail.app</a> in its Tiger incarnation be a really neat <span class="caps">MUA</span> because of the nice interface and the good spam filter it offers. Unfortunately it lacks a little when you have to deal with large amounts of mail or want to use some of the more advanced features other MUAs have to offer, so I started looking around for some plug-ins. I soon found <a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/">Hawk Wings</a>, a site dedicated entirely to &#8220;Tips and add-ons to make Apple Mail even better&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the plug-ins I&#8217;m using so far:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><a href="http://www.sente.ch/software/GPGMail/English.lproj/GPGMail.html">GPGMailBundle</a> (<a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/2005/09/15/gpg-encrypting-messages-in-apple-mail/">Review</a>): Lacking support for <a href="http://gnupg.org/"><span class="caps">GPG</span></a> in the default installation is <span class="caps">IMHO</span> one of the greatest shortcomings of Apple Mail. Fortunately enough there&#8217;s GPGMailBundle to remedy this situation. This nice little plug-in of course needs a working <span class="caps">GPG</span> installtion to function properly and I recommend <a href="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">MacGPG</a> in combination with GPGKeychainAccess from the same site for this. Once you&#8217;re set up and ready to go, GPGMailBundle can easily be configured from Mail&#8217;s preferences panel. A great plug-in, which makes Mail.app a lot more useful to me!</li><br />
<li><a href="http://harnly.net/software/letterbox/letterbox_0.16.html">Letterbox</a> (<a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/2006/06/02/three-pane-mailapp-hack-that-works/">Review</a>): If you too own a widescreen display, Letterbox may just be the plug-in you&#8217;ve been waiting for if you&#8217;re trying to make the most out of your screen real estate. What it does is arranging the interface into three vertical columns by putting the message preview right of the message pane instead of below it (as known from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/entourage2004/entourage2004.aspx">Entourage</a>). This definitely depends on personal preference and reading habits, but so far I really like this layout, especially with all the additional information GPGMailBundle adds to the message preview.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html">Mail Act-On</a> (<a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/2005/08/08/mail-act-on-getting-sorted-saving-time/">Review</a>): A cool plug-in which allows you to create a plethorea of different mail rules and to assign them to keystrokes, therefore making your mail sorting a whole lot faster and more efficient.</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailTags.html">MailTags</a> (<a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/2005/08/24/managing-email-with-mailtags/">Review</a>): Coming from the same author, MailTags does for managing mails what Mail Act-On does for sorting them. It adds a little tag to all messages, which lets you add keywords, notes, due dates, priorities and other useful infos to them. And as if that&#8217;s not cool enough already, you can also build smart mail boxes from this metadata (which btw can be used and changed from Apple Mail rules). Now consider that this great plug-in also allows you to link messages to iCal to do items, and you&#8217;ll immediately see how useful this thing really is. The only thing that annoys me a little is the &#8220;begging&#8221; for donations. Not because I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the money &#8211; I&#8217;m probably going to donate something too &#8211; but because I think the PayPal button on the web site would have sufficed, since I really don&#8217;t want to see it all the time&#8230;</li></p>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it for today, but since there are a lot of other nice and useful looking plug-ins for Apple Mail, I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;ll be a followup post to this in the near future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since too many of life&#8217;s pleasures are demonized by all the greyfaces out there, I&#8217;ve decided to start a new series called &#8220;In defense of&#8221;, where I&#8217;ll collect quotes, song lyrics, etc. which show them in a different and maybe more positive way.</p>
<p>Does love really need that kind of defense? If we&#8217;d be talking about the watered down Hollywood version, this post would most probably be pretty obsolote. But when it comes to the real thing, involving real people, feeling real happiness and despair, things may look a little different&#8230;<br />
<i><br />
&#8220;To live is like to love -<br />
all reason is against it,<br />
and all healthy instinct for it.&#8221;<br />
</i><br />
- Samuel Butler, Life and love</p>

<p>Although a little too pathetic for my taste, it&#8217;s just too cool to have Bruce Lee in here!<br />
<i><br />
&#8220;Love is like a friendship caught on fire.<br />
In the beginning a flame, very pretty,<br />
Often hot and fierce,<br />
But still only light and flickering.<br />
As love grows older,<br />
Our hearts mature<br />
And our love becomes as coals,<br />
Deep-burning and unquenchable.&#8221;<br />
</i><br />
- Bruce Lee</p>
<hr />
<p><i><br />
&#8220;A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature<br />
To stop speech when words become superfluous.&#8221;<br />
</i><br />
- Ingrid Bergman</p>
<hr />
<p><i><br />
&#8220;Love is like a rumor,<br />
Everyone talks about it,<br />
But no one truly knows.&#8221;<br />

<p><i><br />
&#8220;Love is a haunting melody<br />
That I have never mastered<br />
And I fear I never will.&#8221;<br />
</i><br />
- William S. Burroughs</p>
<hr />
<p><i><br />
&#8220;Love me without fear<br />
Trust me without questioning<br />
Need me without demanding<br />
Want me without restrictions<br />
Accept me without change<br />
Desire me without inhibitions<br />
For a love so free&#8230;.<br />
Will never fly away&#8221;.<br />

Love Is A Burning Thing<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every so often you&#8217;ll find what you believed to be your future shattered to pieces on which you cut youself. But this pain is healthy, as it makes your mind clear enough to see through all the layers of artifical bullshit modern society has wrapped around your true feelings. It seems like tears make for excellent magnifying glasses&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Against Me! &#8211; 8 Full Hours Of Sleep</strong><br />
<i>When you sleep,<br />
No one is homeless.<br />
When you sleep,<br />
You can&#8217;t feel the hunger.<br />
When you sleep,<br />
No one is lonely in a dream.<br />
Without classes,<br />
Without nations&#8230;<br />
When you sleep,<br />
She&#8217;s standing there with open arms,<br />
And one night could last forever,<br />
And if you asked her,<br />
She&#8217;d never let go,<br />
And you&#8217;d stay forever&#8230;</p>
<p>And the sun&#8217;s always rising<br />
In the sky somewhere,<br />
And if young hearts should explode<br />
From all the lies they&#8217;ve been told&#8230;</p>
<p>Let the new night bring you peace<br />
And the promise of tomorrow,<br />
Where we can wake to a new beginning.<br />
Tomorrow I&#8217;ll all but have lost their faces;<br />
My friends and family,<br />
Memories of all we had<br />
And the times we should have lived,<br />
And tomorrow America just might fall apart.<br />
Tomorrow, tell me,<br />
Where will you wake up?<br />
Beyond title, beyond these careers and laws,<br />
Something more than borders on a map&#8230;</p>
<p>And the sun&#8217;s always rising in the sky somewhere,<br />
And if young hearts should explode<br />
From all the lies they&#8217;ve been told&#8230;<br />
To live through one night like this,<br />
I would trade it for the silence&#8230;<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since too many of life&#8217;s pleasures are demonized by all the greyfaces out there, I&#8217;ve decided to start a new series called &#8220;In defense of&#8221;, where I&#8217;ll collect quotes, song lyrics, etc. which show them in a different &#8211; and maybe more positive &#8211; way.</p>
<p><i><strong>Kikizo:</strong> So, how many drinks does it take for ideas to stop being feasible, good ideas, and start being just complete nonsense?</p>
<p><strong>Itagaki:</strong> Haha! It&#8217;s hard to say, because I am drinking pretty much full-time. Of course, there are ups and downs, waves, of how I drink in terms of the amount, but it&#8217;s a long period of time. In the last ten years &#8211; not that you asked this question &#8211; I think I had better ideas when I was drinking whisky. When I am drinking shochu, that&#8217;s a conservative drink, so the ideas are not that great. Beer is just like water to me, so it just helps me and everyone else loosen up a little bit, it doesn&#8217;t really contribute to coming up with ideas.</i> (found on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2006/7/4/4522">Ars Technica</a>)</p>

Since I started drinkin&#8217; again <br />
I ain&#8217;t shed one lousy tear over you <br />
Since I started drinkin&#8217; again</p>
<p>I know that the neighbors are all a-talkin&#8217; <br />
They swear that I have lost my mind <br />
Ah, but they do not know <br />
That I&#8217;ve just gained control <br />
Of all the heartache that you left behind</p>

<p>Well I know that the boss is gonna fire me <br />
When I stumble in late to work again <br />
But surprise will replace that old scowl on his face <br />
When he sees that I do not give a damn</p>
