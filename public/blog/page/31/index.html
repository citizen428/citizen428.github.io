  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;but it bought me a Game Cube.</p>
<p>Today at work I got so p*ssed that I decided to go out and spend some money on stuff I don&#8217;t really need. In the end I bought a Nintendo Game Cube, <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-652">Mario Kart Double Dash!!</a>, a memory card, and an additional controller in a shop close to my work, as well as a copy of <a href="http://metroid.com/prime/">Metroid Prime</a> on eBay which I should get in a few days.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">FAQ</span></strong><br />
<em>Q: You know that capitalism only works by making you so depressed that you just need to buy something in order to feel better?</em><br />
A: Yes, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m also pretty ashamed every time I fall for this, but sometimes you just can&#8217;t help it&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Q: Don&#8217;t you think that sucks then?</em><br />
A: Sure I do, but you can&#8217;t get drunk all the time.</p>
<p><em>Q: Why a Game Cube and not a PS2/X-Box/whatever?</em><br />
A: I&#8217;ve collected game consoles starting from the old <span class="caps">NES</span> until Sega stopped producing their own consoles after my beloved Dreamcast. Personally I just think that Nintendo and Sega rock, while MS and Sony&#8230;ahm&#8230;just don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t need the newest and greatest hardware, I just want a nice platform which offers the kind of games I like to play. Additionally I already own a Game Boy Advance for several years, which can be used in conjuction with the Game Cube.</p>
<p><em>Q: You could have bought that Game Cube a lot earlier.</em><br />
A: That&#8217;s not a question.</p>
<p><em>Q: But still&#8230;</em><br />
Well, after Sega announced that they won&#8217;t release any new consoles, I got so depressed and ended my career as a video game collector (I never really liked PC games). Now that I spontanously changed my mind, the Game Cube was the only system I considered worth buying. No flame wars please, I quite regularly play PS2 and X-Box games when hanging out with friends, I just don&#8217;t want to spend my own money on those particular systems.</p>
<p><em>Q: Will you start blogging about Game Cube games now?</em><br />
A: There might be the occasional post on this topic, but this site definitely won&#8217;t turn into a gaming blog.</p>
<p><em>Q: What about the revolution?</em><br />
See blog subtitle.</p>
<p><em>Q: Have you turned into a bitter cynic lately?</em><br />
You&#8217;ve noticed? If I only knew what could be the <a href="http://citizen428.net/archives/254-Why-working-in-Business-IT-sucks.html">reason</a>&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve been to the Depeche Mode concert in the <a href="http://stadthalle.at">Wiener Stadthalle</a> last Thursday. Although it was quite nice, concerts this big definitely aren&#8217;t my thing. They are more like Hollywood movies: good while they last, but nothing life changing or overly surprising. I much more enjoy small Punk or Hardcore concerts, where you can have a beer and a nice chat with the band afterwards and generally feel much more involved&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://teemow.com/">teemow</a> and his girlfriend are going to stay in Vienna for a few days, so I guess we&#8217;ll go out partying tonight which should be good fun! :)</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll have brunch at <a href="http://www.restaurant-leopold.at/">Restaurant Leopold</a> with my girlfriend and will go to see <a href="http://www.thejrewing.com/">JR Ewing</a> and <a href="http://www.coheedandcambria.com/">Coheed and Cambria</a> in the <a href="http://www.arena.co.at/">Arena Wien</a> with my former flatmate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>1. You&#8217;ll turn into a bitter cynic. This in fact is probably the best thing about your job, which really  should make you think&#8230;</p>
<p>2. Only wackos and smartasses work in this field. Depending on which group you belong to, this might even be fun. More often though you&#8217;re screwed.</p>
<p>3. If your boss screws up, it will probably get communicated to the customer as your fault. Given that you took the job in the first place, that&#8217;s even true.</p>
<p>4. Every job where people tell you things along the line of &#8220;An average day has 24 hours and if that isn&#8217;t enough, you&#8217;ll have to make use of the nights too!&#8221; and find that actually funny, is a good reason to spend the rest of your life in a zen buddhist monastery, a mental home or both.</p>
<p>5. The best thing about your average work day is that there&#8217;s always at least one person in the office who is worse off than you (see #1). However, he&#8217;s most likely also the one poor guy who&#8217;s neither a wacko nor a smartass (see #2), so you have to control your bitter cynicism and feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>6. The coffee is cold or bad and the coke is either warm or a diet coke. They&#8217;ve thought about everything!</p>
<p>7. After a certain amount of time you won&#8217;t be able to remember if the sentences &#8220;Resistance is futile. Your life as it has been is over. From this time forward, you will service us.&#8221; have been said by your boss or Locutus of Borg. What&#8217;s even worse is that it doesn&#8217;t really make a difference anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;m also planning on writing up some reasons for &#8220;Why working in Business IT rocks&#8221;. Yeah, right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Personal:</strong><br />
Yesterday I had the last seminar of my university &#8220;career&#8221;, which feels kind of strange. As the people who know me better can tell you, for the past few years I&#8217;ve always been torn between a job in the technical field and pursuing an academic career in humanities. Now that I&#8217;ve surprisingly found a job which allows me to work full time on/with free software, it seems that this decision has finally been made, but there still is a certain amount of uncertainty&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong><br />
During yesterday&#8217;s lunch break we&#8217;ve been to a nice <a href="http://falter.at/web/wwei/detail.php?nr=679&amp;ref=bezirk%3D9%26kueche%3D231%26teil%3D1">Korean restaurant</a> which offers nice set meals (consisting of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miso_soup">miso soup</a>, a salad and a main course) in the range of 6,20-10,20 Euro. The beef <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibimbap">bibimbap</a> is great and everything else also was really good.</p>
<p>In the evening we&#8217;ve ordered a nice pizza which goes really well with Friday night TV, and today I&#8217;ll meet some friends at the <a href="http://www.blunzenstricker.at/">Blunzenstricker</a> to have some solid Austrian food. :)</p>
<p><strong>Books:</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve just finished J.G. Ballard&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/000225848X/002-3286426-3377608?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Millenium People</a> which I wholeheartedly recommend to everyone! Currently I&#8217;m reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345404475/qid=1139069018/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-3286426-3377608?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a> by Philip K. Dick, which is long overdue given that I have seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</a> a gazillion times but never actually came around to read the book.</p>
<p>As it&#8217;s pretty thin I went to a book store today and came home with <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/3453400526/202-6097115-8739022">The Cocka Hola company</a> by Matias Faldbakken, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156029987/qid=1139068428/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/002-3286426-3377608?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">Vernon God Little</a> by <span class="caps">DBC</span> Pierre and Alan Bisset&#8217;s <a href="http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/incredibleadamspark.html">The incredible Adam Spark</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This will probably result in a flamewar, but I&#8217;m really interested in hearing all your opinions here: after a long time of avoiding any desktop related software looking even remotely like it might have to do with <span class="caps">KDE</span>/QT and following <span class="caps">GNOME</span> development pretty closely, I&#8217;ve finally decided to have a look at <span class="caps">KDE</span> again.</p>
<p>To my surprise I quite like what I see. Especially Kontact looks like a spiffy piece of software, but other applications seem to be pretty cool too.</p>
<p>I soon should get a work laptop, and I&#8217;ll only install <span class="caps">KDE</span> on it to see how I like it for perfoming my day to day tasks. Everyone deserves a fair chance, I&#8217;ve once even tried Emacs for a few days to see why I love Vim ;) Once I start this little experiment, I&#8217;ll try to ocassionally blog about my experiences. Any <span class="caps">KDE</span> fans out there, please post some comments and tell me about cool stuff you think I should try/know about/whatever&#8230;</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>: E17 also seems to have improved quite a lot since I&#8217;ve last installed it, and it looks really sweet.</p>
<p>BTW2: I&#8217;ve recently also rediscovered my love for Ion3, so here&#8217;s right another contestor for the &#8220;citizen428&#8217;s preffered <span class="caps">GUI</span>&#8221; competition&#8230;</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a little info for the people who may wonder about my lack of activity lately (mainly the Ruby herd and some guys of the Gentoo/<span class="caps">ALT</span> project): I&#8217;ve started a new job as a Junior Systems Engineer for a company providing open source solutions for enterprise customers, which means I&#8217;ve recently been playing around with stuff like Linux Heartbeat and other cool technologies. It&#8217;s quite stressful, but also pretty interesting so far and I quite like it (despite my constant rambling about having a regular job).</p>
<p>However, in January I also had to finish the last few classes of my college career, so there actually was nearly no time left for Gentoo, as the measly 4 commits I did demonstrate pretty well. I still have a seminar this Friday where I&#8217;ll present the concept of my diploma thesis, but starting from next week I&#8217;ll try to do more Gentoo related things again. :)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While reading <a href="netzpolitik.org">netzpolitik.org</a> yesterday, I found a link to an article on the <a href="http://opennetinitiative.net/blog/">OpenNet Initiative Blog</a>, explaining <a href="http://www.opennetinitiative.net/blog/?p=87">how the filtering of Google.cn works</a>. Now let&#8217;s have a closer look at some of the blocked sites:</p>
<p>site:hrw.org<br />
site:hrichina.org</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch and Human Rights in China. Who is surprised that they get blocked? Nobody? Guessed so&#8230;</p>
<p>site:rfa.org</p>
<p>Radio Free Asia describes itself in the following way: &#8220;<em><span class="caps">RFA</span> is a private, nonprofit corporation that broadcasts news and information in nine native Asian languages to listeners who do not have access to full and free news media. The purpose of <span class="caps">RFA</span> is to provide a forum for a variety of opinions and voices from within these Asian countries.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>site:tsquare.tv</p>
<p>A pretty informative site about the incident on Tiananmen Square in 1989. You really should try to see the <a href="http://tsquare.tv/film/">documentary</a>, it&#8217;s probably the best I&#8217;ve seen so far on this topic.</p>
<p>http://64memo.com/</p>
<p>The Tianmen Massacre Memorial Museum. I haven&#8217;t read any of the articles on this site yet, so it&#8217;s hard to tell how exactly they are dealing with the subject.</p>
<p>site:news.bbc.co.uk<br />
site:voa.gov</p>
<p>Ok, the <span class="caps">BBC</span> and Voice of America may not be the most objective news sources one can find in the world, but blocking them seems a little harsh.</p>
<p>site:boxun.com<br />
site:peacehall.com</p>
<p>Both domains will lead you to the Boxun News Network, a site writing a lot about censorship, free speech and similar topics.</p>
<p>site:freechina.net</p>
<p>After having a look at the <a href="http://www.freechina.net/goal/index_en.htm">goals</a> of The Free China Movement, it should be pretty obvious why the Chinese government wants this site blocked.</p>
<p>site:geocities.com</p>
<p>Free web hosting == free expression? It seems so&#8230;</p>
<p>site:falundafa.org<br />
site:epochtimes.com</p>
<p>After having been at a conference with participants from these groups I have to say that I don&#8217;t feel any sympathy for them, but that definitely isn&#8217;t an excuse for locking them up and censoring their sites.</p>
<p>site:savetibet.org</p>
<p>It should be pretty obvious why this got blocked.</p>
<p>site:topforum.com</p>
<p>A dynamic index of Chinese forums websites.</p>
<p>site:laogai.org</p>
<p>Since 1992 the Laogai Research Foundation is trying to gather information on Chinese penal camps and other &#8220;<em>systemic human rights violations in China, including public executions, organ harvesting from executed prisoners, the coercive enforcement of China&#8217;s population control policy, and persecution of religious believers.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess that sites like the <a href="http://www.china-labour.org.hk/public/main">China Labour Bulletin</a> and related worker&#8217;s movements get filtered as well, but I can&#8217;t personally confirm this currently.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just noticed that I haven&#8217;t blogged much lately, so the least I can do is put together one of my random link dumps for you:</p>

Sure, <span class="caps">LAMP</span> (Linux, Apache, MySQL, <span class="caps">PHP</span>) has proven itself to be a pretty neat platform for web development.

If you want to learn a little more about alternative technologies head over to <span class="caps">FLPR</span> to read up on web development with FreeBSD, lighttpd, PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails.</li></p>
<li><a href="http://onestepback.org/articles/lingo/index.html">Speaking the Lingo</a>: <br />
A nice presentation on creating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Specific_Language">domain specific languages</a> with Ruby</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today when I talked with a non-techy friend from the Midde East on IM, the topic of free speech on the net came up. I then started telling him about <a href="http://tor.eff.org/overview.html.en">Tor</a> and how hidden services could be a solution to this. But when I sent him the links, he couldn&#8217;t open them, but instead saw the following:</p>
<p><em>We apologize the site you are attempting to visit has been blocked due to its content being inconsistent with the religious, cultural, political and moral values of [insert country here]</em>.</p>
<p>I guess it should have been obvious that countries which censor the net wouldn&#8217;t easily give their citizens the information needed to circumvent this censorship, but still I was pretty baffled by this.</p>
<p>So please everyone, spread the word about Tor and consider if you want to <a href="http://tor.eff.org/volunteer.html.en">volunteer</a> or <a href="http://tor.eff.org/donate.html.en">donate</a> something to the effort!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday evening <a href="http://www.leyrer.priv.at/martin/">m3&#8217;s</a> girlfriend <a href="http://www.webcave.at/">Susanne</a> organized a little surprise dinner at <a href="http://www.pancho.at/mas/index.htm">mas</a> to celebrate Martin&#8217;s 35th birthday, which was really relaxing and entertaing. :) It was just what I needed after a rather unnerving day at university, and it really made me look forward to my other &#8220;social events&#8221; this week (the monthly <a href="http://www.aglug.net/"><span class="caps">AGLUG</span></a> meeting on Thursday and another <a href="http://pardus.at/">Pardus</a> meetup on Saturday).</p>
<p>Today was my second day in my new job, which I mostly spent on heartbeat scripts and a &#8220;funny&#8221; server which shows some irritating behavior. I also had to build my first deb package for the deployment of some in-house software, and I have to say that I now love Portage more than ever&#8230; ;)</p>
