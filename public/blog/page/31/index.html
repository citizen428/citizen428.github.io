  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a little less than four hours, <a href="http:berq.net">berq</a>, <a href="http://twoday.tuwien.ac.at/perm">lippi</a>, <a href="http://red667.org">red667</a>, and me will leave for Berlin where we&#8217;re going to attend the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Home">23C3</a>. Since the <a href="http://oebb.at">Ã–BB</a> still sucks, we&#8217;re once again going by bus, arriving tomorrow at around 6:30am. Judging from last year the time between our arrival until we can check into our <a href="http://www.hostels.com/en/availability.php/HostelNumber.10594">hostel</a> at around noon will be spent drinking beer, which definitely isn&#8217;t a recommended breakfast option. Kids, don&#8217;t try this at home!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we&#8217;ll once again have loads of fun, and unlike the last years I plan on regularly blogging and posting pics from the event, so stay tuned! Anyone interested in meeting up at the 23C3 either post a comment here or send a mail to my GMail account.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Jethro Tull, Christmas song</strong></p>
<p>Once in Royal David&#8217;s City<br />
Stood a lonely cattle shed<br />
Where a mother held her baby<br />
You&#8217;d do well to remember the things He later said</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re stuffing yourselves at the Christmas parties<br />
You&#8217;ll just laugh when I tell you to take a running jump<br />
You&#8217;re missing the point I&#8217;m sure does not need making<br />
That Christmas spirit is not what you drink</p>
<p>So how can you laugh when your own mother&#8217;s hungry<br />
And how can you smile when the reasons for smiling are wrong?<br />
And if I just messed up your thoughtless pleasures<br />
Remember, if you wish, this is just a Christmas song</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I&#8217;ve blogged about me being uncertain whether to get myself a Nintento Wii or an Xbox 360 (please don&#8217;t tell me to get both, that thought is too tempting already!). Currently Big N&#8217;s latest offering is a slight favorite again, since &#8211; after an exhausting few days partying &#8211; I spent the late afternoon and early evening playing <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/556/556422p1.html">Paper Mario: The Thounsand-Year Door</a>, which is one of the most entertaining and funny games I&#8217;ve ever played. Later on I decided to finally try out the <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> with Mario Kart DS (friend code: 197655187733), and I have to say that I just love it, which means that now I really have to get myself a copy of <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/697/697307p1.html">Metroid Prime Hunters</a> as soon as possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you may know I&#8217;m a big fan of video game consoles. I currently own two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES"><span class="caps">NES</span></a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNES"><span class="caps">SNES</span></a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Drive">Mega Drive</a>  (aka Genesis), a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playstation">PS1</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Cube">Game Cube</a> and loads of games. I also played quite a lot on the other systems common in Europe (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn">Saturn</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N64">N64</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS2">PS2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox">Xbox</a>). Among the listed systems, the Dreamcast is probably still my favorite for being really innovative and having lots of great games, with the GC coming in a close second. But I&#8217;ve had great times with all of them &#8211; the original Mario Kart on the <span class="caps">SNES</span> and most Square titles on the PS1 come to mind. Of course I also love handhelds and own an original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> (which is unfortunately broken), a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBA"><span class="caps">GBA</span></a> and a black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Lite">Nintendo DS LIte</a>, which <span class="caps">IMHO</span> is the coolest portable gaming system I&#8217;ve ever seen (with honorable mentions for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Nomad">Sega Nomad</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Express">Turbo Express</a>).</p>
<p>As you can see I own everything Nintendo ever made except for the N64, which too had a lot of great games but which I somehow never bought. And I really love their products. But I also was always very fond of Sega&#8217;s systems, and when the company announced that they wouldn&#8217;t produce any more consoles after the DC, I was pretty sure that I won&#8217;t buy another game console ever. That held true for a surprisingly long time, until I got myself a GC at the beginning of this year, because (1) the console fever got me again and (2) it was ridiculously cheap because it was already close to the end of it&#8217;s life cycle. And although I currently hardly take the time to play with the systems I already own, I&#8217;m considering buying a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games_%28seventh_generation_era%29">seventh generation console</a>.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a> vs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3">PS3</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a>. I&#8217;m definitely not going to get myself a PS3. First off I&#8217;m not interested in Blu-ray, <span class="caps">HDMI</span> and the other fancy stuff, and secondly I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Copy_Protection">Sony sucks</a>. Besides that at least two of my friends will get one, so I can play the newest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Evolution_Soccer"><span class="caps">PES</span></a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29"><span class="caps">GTA</span></a> with them. So of course the Wii would be an obvious choice: it has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess">Twilight Princess</a>, is made by Nintendo and features this incredibly cool controller. And did I mention  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess">Twilight Princess</a>? Besides that it offers wireless, the option to play my GC games (I could save a little room by storing the GC someplace else), a cool download feature and I&#8217;m sure there will be interesting possibilities to use it in conjunction with the DS. But yesterday I suddenly realized that I never considered the Xbox 360. None of my friends has one, and nobody mentioned any plans to buy it. So I read up on it a little, and somehow I started to like the system. Sure, it&#8217;s made by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">the big evil company</a> and it doesn&#8217;t exactly offer original games. But it has <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/744/744356p1.html">Gears of War</a>, <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/741/741860p1.html">F.E.A.R</a>, <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/717/717824p1.html">Prey</a> and a lot more good shooters. And I really like playing shooters. Then there&#8217;s <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/698/698400p1.html">Oblivion</a>, which by itself may justify getting a 360. Considering the upcoming <a href="http://halo3.com/">Halo 3</a> and <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/707/707567p1.html">Star Trek Legacy</a>, the system might well be worth its money for me. Plus I&#8217;ve never owned a Microsoft console. Actually I was pretty sure I never will, but since <a href="http://gnulords.org/~colo/">colo</a> mentioned that he&#8217;s interested in a <span class="caps">PSP</span>, I&#8217;m surprised by anything anymore.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m still pondering wether to buy a new console or not, but if I do, I&#8217;m not sure anymore that I will be a Wii.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As always December turns out to be the busiest month of the year: Last Monday I met up with <a href="http://berq.net/">berq</a> and <a href="http://gnulords.org/~colo/misc/quotes.txt">colo</a> for beer, dinner and nerd talk, which I really enjoyed. On Thursday the ominous <a href="http://blingblingsquad.net/">[[:bbs:]]</a> had its Christmas party, which as expected led to loads of consumed alcohol and a headache on the next day. Nonetheless I joined the Viennese <a href="http://www.pardus.at">Pardus</a> meeting on Friday after having dinner with Silvia and a friend of hers. Yesterday <a href="http://www.cargal.org">Steve</a> came to Vienna, so we and some other friends went to have dinner (best Sushi I ever enjoyed outside of Asia) and some drinks afterwards. Since this week&#8217;s schedule didn&#8217;t leave me enough time to attend my Taekwondo classes, I got up after ~6h of sleep this morning to attend the class at 10:00am.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all, as next week will be equally busy: On Wednesday I&#8217;m going to see <a href="http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/">Placebo</a> at the <a href="http://www.stadthalle.com/">Wiener Stadthalle</a>. Yes, that&#8217;s quite different from the rather small punk and hardcore concerts I usually go to, but I somehow like them and want to see if they&#8217;ll live up to their good reputation as a live band. On Thursday yours truly will attend the Christmas party of his former employer, while on Friday my current company will have one. Saturday I&#8217;ll meet up with a friend of mine who&#8217;s visiting from Beijing, while I plan on spending a relaxing day at the spa on Sunday.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell now the week before Christmas will also be full with dinners, parties and other appointments, and the week after that I&#8217;m in Berlin for the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Home">23C3</a>. To cut a long story short: if you&#8217;re interested in a meeting either join me for one of the activities listed above or you&#8217;ll probably have to wait until 2007. Wow, I feel important now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This evening I found some time to work on my blog again, so here&#8217;s a quick rundown of things that changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share and save:</strong> After reading the templates used by <a href="http://s9y.org">Serendipity</a> to get a hang of <a href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a>, I&#8217;ve edited entries.tpl to include a mailto link to share entries, as well as the possibility to digg posts or add them to del.icio.us. There ya go, Web 2.0 lovers.</li>
<li><strong>Feed love:</strong> Syndication rocks, especially when using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> which offers great features like the Link Splicer which automatically creates this &#8220;Links for the day&#8221; entries out of my del.icio.us bookmarks. But since I also got an account on <a href="http://citizen428.suprglu.com/">SuprGlu</a>, I&#8217;ve decided to additionally provide you with the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/citizen428stalker">citizen428stalker</a> feed, which additionally contains my flickr photos, my Plazes traze, info from 43 Things and 43 Places and much more. So if you&#8217;re up for the whole citizen428 package, you might want to give this new feed a try.</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&#8217;t come around to do any more <span class="caps">CSS</span> changes yet, but that&#8217;s next on my list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After my two private lessons last week I had my first full Taekwondo training session today. Here&#8217;s what I learned: My overall lifestyle and sports don&#8217;t really mix. Sex, drugs and Rock&#8217;n&#8217;Roll &#8211; unfortunately I&#8217;m doing way better in some categories than in others &#8211; definitely took a beating (pun intended) from martial arts. My lungs declared war on me (damn you cheap Chinese cigarettes!), my pulse was going so fast that I was afraid an 8bit counter might not suffice for counting it and various other parts of my body just seemed very surprised to get used again. But once this painful first 15 minutes were over, the following 50 minutes were actually pretty cool and I&#8217;m looking forward to Thursday&#8217;s session.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After using it for quite a while, I got bored with the old look of my blog and so I started to update it today. Here&#8217;s a quick rundown of things that changed:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><strong>Added various links:</strong> I&#8217;ve updated the sidebar to include links to <a href="http://myspace.com/citizen428">my MySpace profile</a> (resistance really is futile) and <a href="http://citizen428.suprglu.com/">my SuprGlu site</a> (making it easier for you stalkers). I&#8217;ve also readded the links to my profiles on <a href="http://www.43things.com/person/citizen428">43 Things</a> and <a href="http://www.43places.com/person/citizen428">43 Plazes</a>, so it&#8217;s a happy day for all you buzzword loving Web 2.0 fans out there.</li><br />
<li><strong>Advanced syndication:</strong> I got rid of my blog&#8217;s own syndication features in favor of <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/citizen428/">FeedBurner</a>. Why? Because it offers really cool stuff like &#8220;SmartFeeds&#8221; which create the right <span class="caps">RSS</span>/Atom feeds for the reader you use on the fly, &#8220;link slicing&#8221; (a daily entry of links I add to <a href="http://del.icio.us/citizen428">my del.icio.us account</a> gets generated and added to the feed) and the possibility to subscribe to this blog via email. If you are among my true fans who have  subscribed to this site long ago don&#8217;t despair, I&#8217;m 301 redirecting most of the old syndication links to FeedBurner (the <span class="caps">RSS</span> 0.91 feed is used to push data to FeedBurner).</li><br />
<li><strong>More syndication features:</strong> I&#8217;ve signed up for <a href="http://talkr.com">Talkr</a> so you lazy folks have the chance to get this site as a Podcast, without me having to go through the hassle of actually recording one. Nifty, eh? Besides that I get US$ 7 for everyone who signs up to Talkr for at least 30 days, and since Christmas is near that just sounds like the perfect opportunity to make yours truly happy, doesn&#8217;t it? ;) Apart from the Podcast goodness there&#8217;s now also a convenient link to add this site to your <a href="http://del.icio.us/citizen428">Technorati</a> favorites with just a single click of your mouse, which means lazyness finally is no longer an excuse for not doing so.</li><br />
<li><strong>Sidebar reorganization:</strong> Dropped some plugins, added, rearranged and reconfigured some others.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>As you can see I&#8217;ve also changed the theme from my tweaked version of &#8220;Joshua&#8221; to the Serendipity port of &#8220;Modern World&#8221;. I like the overall look of the theme quite a lot, but there are various changes I want to apply to the <span class="caps">CSS</span> as soon as I can be bothered to do so. Until now I&#8217;ve only changed some of the colors, but once I&#8217;m done it would be pretty cool if this site wouldn&#8217;t only look good, but also validate as <span class="caps">XHMTL</span>. I&#8217;m also in need of a logo sized 220&#215;128 pixels, so if you&#8217;re feeling creative and want to surprise me, send your work of art to my Gmail address. Once I finally take over leadership of the world, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be pretty happy to say &#8220;I did the logo for this guy&#8217;s website&#8221;.</p>
