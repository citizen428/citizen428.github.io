  <div class="entry-content"><p>I generally observed that people tend to bring up the <span class="caps">POLS</span> when <i>they</i> find one specific aspect counter-intuitive. For example you sometimes will hear people complain about how the &#8220;modulo operator&#8221; (String#% really) is used for formatting strings in Ruby which in their opinion violates the <span class="caps">POLS</span>:<br />
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;%05d&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">123</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;00123&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div></p>
<p>Well, when you start out from the wrong assumption that the percent sign is the &#8220;modulo operator&#8221;, you can only reach wrong conclusions.</p>
<p>In mathematical textbooks you will generally find &#8216;mod&#8217; used in this context, which is also the operator used in e.g. Haskell. The surprise in this case stems from the assumption that the symbol % is in some way tied to the modulo operation, which it only is in some programming languages (mod, rem, &#92;, remainder, modulo, |~, %% and <span class="caps">IDIV</span> being some other options).</p>
<p>This is not intended to sound harsh, I just think that whenever you feel Ruby violates the <span class="caps">POLS</span>, it&#8217;s probably a good time to check your own assumptions and find out that for people with a better understanding of the topic at hand, the <span class="caps">POLS</span> most likely did not get violated. Don&#8217;t confuse &#8220;what I would expect&#8221; with &#8220;what the majority of people knowledgeable in a given area find surprising&#8221;. When I traveled in Bulgaria I found it very confusing that people there shake their head for &#8220;yes&#8221; and nod for &#8220;no&#8221;. Turns out all the locals were perfectly fine with it&#8230; ;-)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a striking similarity between unicorns and good math teachers: both are mythical creatures you really wish existed whereas empirical evidence strongly suggests they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Looking back at my own experience in Austrian public schools, the average quality of math teaching was atrocious. It&#8217;s only partly the teachers&#8217; fault though, since math generally seems to be taught in a rather frustrating way. There&#8217;s a definite tendency to leave out vital information like why a mathematical method was created, what problem it was meant to solve and how it evolved over time. Instead of starting from the perspective of a tangible problem and looking at the development of methods to solve it, we get a high-level abstract view and are kinda left in the dark as to how that ever may be useful, leading to the common misconception that &#8220;math is useless in everyday life&#8221;. It&#8217;s a bit like teaching kids about <span class="caps">DNA</span> and expecting them to see deer frolicking in the forest before their mental eye. That being said, it still often <i>is</i> the teacher&#8217;s fault: sometimes it feels like schools are elephant graveyards where old mathematicians go to die, so poor students often end up with grumpy frustrated people who barely seem to remember why they got into math in the first place and therefore definitely don&#8217;t create the spark necessary to ignite a young person&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>In retrospect, this makes me quite angry. As long as I can remember I have loved numbers in an almost obsessive way. When I get bored I start counting things around me, try to find patterns in tiles or do random calculations. So of course I always loved math in school and tended to do very well. Then 7th grade came and the subject slowly started to get more abstract. Bad methodology, combined with awful teaching and beginning puberty on my part were enough to make math my most feared subject in the years to come. Occasionally my original enthusiasm for the subject resurfaced and my grades got a bit better again when we began with calculus. Math still mainly was a major pain in the behind for me though. This only changed when at age 17 I finally convinced my parents of how broken the Austrian public school system was and switched to a private school where class attendance was voluntary and everything more or less worked like it later would at uni. This was the only time I can remember where I was lucky enough to have a good math teacher. In fact he wasn&#8217;t only good, he was excellent and is probably one of the main reasons why I&#8217;m now studying math. He did an incredible job making us understand the beauty of the subject and managed to get good results out of almost everyone by never accepting an &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand this&#8221;. He would just go back to the last line the student understood and start working from there: &#8220;How did we get to this line?&#8221;, &#8220;Do you see what substitution we did?&#8221;, &#8220;Now how do you think we got from B to C?&#8221; etc. Using this method, the students generally managed to solve the exercises and obviously were proud and therefore slowly got over the &#8220;math is not for me&#8221; type of thinking. As an additional benefit everyone who was afraid of asking also got a very detailed explanation and would be more likely to ask a question him- or herself next time. Our teacher also was very good at assessing a student&#8217;s level and therefore could give you tailor-made exercises to avoid frustration or boredom. His classes were definitely among the best I saw in almost 20 years of formal education.</p>
<p>Anyway, when it was time to decide what to study at uni, part of me wanted to do math because of my original love for the subject and the great classes I just had experienced. The greater part however still hadn&#8217;t gotten over the feeling of insufficiency accumulated over the years of lost interest due to bad teaching, so in the end I settled on studying Chinese, which was fun but a rather random choice and not all that useful in hindsight. Only after I turned 30 last summer I finally decided I want to give math at university level a try and signed up for an undergrad math degree at a distance learning university. So far everything seems to be going well &#8211; given the fact that I didn&#8217;t do much math in the last 10 years except for reading the occasional book on the subject &#8211; and I&#8217;m really enjoying it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really believe I will ever become a great mathematician, but it is quite frustrating that school almost stopped me from at least trying.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a little follow-up to <a href="http://citizen428.net/archives/423-The-Birthday-Paradox-in-Clojure.html">my recent post on the Birthday Paradox</a> I decided to clean up the code and also plot the relationship between group size and the probability of a shared birthday with <a href="http://incanter.org/">Incanter</a> (mostly because I wanted to show off 1.2&#8217;s <a href="http://data-sorcery.org/2010/04/04/new-chart-theme/">hot new default theme</a>).</p>
<p>Code:<br />

<p>I just love how easy it is to explore problems like this with Clojure and then use Incanter go get some cute little plot too! :-)</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: Incanter&#8217;s author David Liebke sent me <a href="http://twitter.com/liebke/status/12242784190">a version of the above that fits into one tweet</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/6aa65685559cdb5b6e5e">another one with a Latex annotation</a>! I updated my code to incorporate some of his suggestions.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love questions that start with &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if Ruby &lt;insert perceived missing feature&gt;?&#8221; because more often than not the answer is: &#8220;Just tell it to!&#8221;</p>
<p>Something like this happened on RubyLearning today, when fellow mentor José asked &#8220;<i>Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if Ruby was smart enough to realize that when a division has a remainder then it should use a floating result?</i>&#8221; and once again the answer was &#8220;You mean like this?&#8221;:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/365000.js?file=gistfile1.ru"></script><p>I&#8217;m definitely not saying monkey-patching core classes with unexpected behavior is a smart idea (it&#8217;s <span class="caps">NOT</span>), but I always like how you can add behavior to Ruby if you really feel it&#8217;s necessary (and once again, I don&#8217;t in this case).</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Birthday Paradox</a> is an interesting little problem in probability theory. To quote Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>[&#8230;] the birthday problem, or birthday paradox pertains to the probability that in a set of randomly chosen people some pair of them will have the same birthday. In a group of at least 23 randomly chosen people, there is more than 50% probability that some pair of them will have the same birthday. Such a result is counter-intuitive to many.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t really find this counter-intuitive, but as Kalid from <a href="http://betterexplained.com/">BetterExplained</a> accurately <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-birthday-paradox/">observed</a> &#8220;exponents aren&#8217;t intuitive&#8221; and &#8220;humans are a tad bit selfish&#8221;. Here&#8217;s a quote regarding that last comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a room of 23, do you think of the 22 comparisons where your birthday is being compared against someone else’s? Probably.</p><p>Do you think of the 231 comparisons where someone you don’t know is being checked against someone else you don’t know? Do you realize there are so many? Probably not.</p><p>The fact that we neglect the 10 times as many comparisons that don’t include us helps us see why the “paradox” can happen.</p><footer><strong>Kalid Azad</strong> <cite><a href='http://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-birthday-paradox/'>Understanding the Birthday Paradox</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
<p>So let&#8217;s use Clojure to see why math works better than people&#8217;s intuition:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When reading John Derbyshire&#8217;s excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prime-Obsession-Bernhard-Greatest-Mathematics/dp/0309085497">Prime Obsession</a>, I stumbled upon the following interesting footnote about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)">Euler&#8217;s number</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Here is an example of e turning up unexpectedly. Select a random number between 0 and 1. Now select another and add it to the first. Keep doing this, piling on random numbers. How many random numbers, on average, do you need to make the total greater than 1? Answer: 2.71828&#8230;</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Personally I found this rather intriguing, so I decided to try this out for myself. Clojure seemed to be an obvious choice for this, since it&#8217;s very easy to express ones thoughts in code.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with a function that will tell us how many random numbers we needed to sum up to get over 1:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/363888.js?file=gistfile1.clj"></script><p>Next we will create a function that will take n elements from an infinite list generated from another function:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/363888.js?file=gistfile2.clj"></script><p>We are doing this because def-ing a seq will cache it:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/363888.js?file=gistfile3.clj"></script><p>Now we have to find out how many numbers it takes on average to go over 1:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/363888.js?file=gistfile4.clj"></script><p>Let&#8217;s wrap it all up and also display the results as floats:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/363888.js?file=gistfile5.clj"></script><p>Sure enough, the results seem to be around the value of e, curiosity satisfied. Last but not least the final program in all its glory:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/363888.js?file=gistfile6.clj"></script><p>Note: this will die with an <span class="caps">OOM</span> error when you try to calculate the average of a too long list. Fixing this is left as an exercise for the reader (&#8220;holding on to the head&#8221; will probably be useful as a search term).</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I spent some time figuring out how to move <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?creating-an-ami-ebs.html"><span class="caps">EBS</span>-backed AMIs</a> between different EC2 regions. To save you the effort, here&#8217;s a quick summary:<br />
<ul><br />
<li> create a volume from the snapshot backing the <span class="caps">AMI</span></li><br />
<li> attach this volume to a running instance and mount it</li><br />
<li> create a new volume in the target region</li><br />
<li> attach to a running instance, format and mount</li><br />
<li> in the source region, connect to your instance</li><br />
<li> rsync (over ssh, so no messing with security groups) the mounted volume to the target volume</li><br />
<li> once the rsync is done, create a snapshot in the target region</li><br />
<li> register this snapsho as new <span class="caps">AMI</span> with <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/dg/2007-01-03/CLTRG-register.html">ec2-register</a></li></p>
</ul>
<p>Not rocket science, but definitely not as good as just being able to share your own AMIs between regions&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When ClojureX was started it tried to be everything for everybody. Not only did it checkout and compile the git HEADs of clojure, clojure-contrib and jline, it also (optionally) downloaded packages for Clojure support in TextMate or Emacs, configured and installed them. This has two obvious drawbacks. First off, people end up downloading stuff they don&#8217;t need. With current disk sizes and connection speeds that&#8217;s probably not much of a problem, but some users may still find annoying. More importantly though it was hard to keep up with the upstream changes, e.g. clojure-contrib&#8217;s recent switch to Maven.</p>
<p>So now instead of trying to provide a one-size-fits-all solution I&#8217;m taking a totally different approach: from now on ClojureX will only contain the most recent <strong>stable</strong> releases of clojure, clojure-contrib and jline, as well as a very full-featured clj script:</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/310392.js?file=ClojureX+help"></script><p>I know that this potentially makes ClojureX less useful to some people, but I do believe that it&#8217;s one of the fastest and most painless ways to set up a Clojure development environment.</p></div>
