  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I get the same questions over and over again, I decided to do this update in the form of a little Q&amp;A session:</p>
<p>Q: How long will you be traveling for?<br />
A: Don&#8217;t know. Until I&#8217;m done I guess. I don&#8217;t really want to go back to Austria before summer 2009 though&#8230;</p>
<p>Q: So you got stuck in Istanbul. What&#8217;s her name?<br />
A: No girl involved, honestly. For once I&#8217;m doing something stupid out of my own free will. ;)</p>
<p>Q: Do you speak any Turkish yet?<br />
A: Well, I picked up some random words and phrases in the last month, but since I want to learn quicker I&#8217;m now taking a course (12 lessons a week).</p>
<p>Q: Is Istanbul safe?<br />
A: Yup, definitely, at least if you have some form of common sense (e.g. showing huge amounts of foreign currency in dark side streets at 2am is probably not a smart move and the random guy who starts a nice conversation in Sultanahmet will at one point try to sell you a carpet). People here seem to be really afraid of terrorism though, so you see loads of armed cops and have to pass metal detectors every time you want to go on a subway or in a mall (or other public building/sight). And since they don&#8217;t have trash cans in the city center because somebody could hide a bomb in them, I came to detest all kinds of wrappings.</p>
<p>Q: How&#8217;s public transport?<br />
A: Okayish. There&#8217;s busses, ferries, trams, dolmus (minibus taxis) and subways. Of course the subway lines don&#8217;t meet, so changing between them is not an easy feat. The busses however go all over the city (if they manage to go at all because of the insane traffic), but whoever designed the bus stops here must be a strong believer in Darwinism and the survival of the fittest. Why? Because it can be damn hard to find out which busses leave at any given stop and where they are headed.  Schedules are unheard of (well, they can be looked up online, but that&#8217;s almost like believing in the tooth fairy) and intermediate stops don&#8217;t get announced on the busses. So once you figure out how to go to a place, you make that knowledge your best kept family secret, because at one point it may turn out to be a competitive advantage (&#8216;My kids know how to get to the university!&#8217;). Ok, it&#8217;s not always that bad and people are actually very helpful, but on several occasions walking was way faster and less annoying than being stuck in a traffic jam on an overcrowded bus.</p>
<p>Q: How are the people in Istanbul?<br />
A: Awesome! Their hospitality puts us all to shame and the young people are well educated and very interested in topics like world politics, religion etc. Of course my perspective probably is a little skewed because I mostly hang out with students, but I firmly believe that if everybody in Austria would be so welcoming and helpful to foreigners as people are here, that country of ours would be a much nicer place.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some more questions, but I can&#8217;t really be bothered answering them right now, so I&#8217;ll save them for a future update.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here we go for part two of my &#8220;amazing&#8221; adventures. And despite Istanbul being only the second stop on my trip, it seems like I&#8217;ll already throw my plans overboard here. In theory I will board a plane on Monday morning and go to Muscat (Oman), from where I&#8217;d head to Mumbai on the 29th. My friend Josiah already expects me there and we have a road trip to Goa and Bangalore planned.</p>
<p>The only problem is, I don&#8217;t see myself leaving Istanbul right now, and I don&#8217;t even really know why. Sure, there are some pretty amazing sights, but that&#8217;s definitely not what fascinates me. Plus I&#8217;ve already been to a lot of them (Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi palace, Galata Tower, the Basilica Cistern and so on). It&#8217;s more about the whole Asia meets Europe and tradition meets modernity thing I guess. And the fact that I never before stayed in a city which seems to exactly have my pace.</p>
<p>So? Honestly, I don&#8217;t know. The current idea is to find a cheap room in a shared flat and stay there till end of April/end of May and learn as much Turkish as possible in that time. In all likelihood India will still be there in a couple of month and my visa is valid till mid-July, so this part of my travels can easily be postponed.</p>
<p>Hope all of you are doing fine, keep me updated on what you are up to!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After quitting my job and my apartment I finally left Austria last Friday. Since I found a really cheap flight with Sky Europe (22 Euro), I made Athens my first destination. For the first 4 nights I stayed at Kostas&#8217; place in Kipseli and we had loads of fun! Among the highlights were eating in tradtional taverns, going out in Psiiri (pretty cool drum&#8217;n&#8217;bass party on the first night), drinking my first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakomelo">Rakomelo</a> at the CouchSurfing meeting before watching anarchists attacking police with molotows in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exarcheia">Exarcheia</a>, going to a party till 7.15am the next morning (and going back home in a way too crowded car), playing Go at cafes and other places, having Suvlaki on the roof of a house on the way up to Acropolis overlooking the city and smoking shisha and drinking Raki in a small Turkish bar.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I moved to Natalia&#8217;s and Dinos&#8217; place, where we had a really fun game evening accompanied by quite some Rakomelo (I love this drink by the way, Christmas markets in Austria better sell this once I get back!). Yesterday I finally did some touristy stuff and went to the Acropolis. To be honest the 12 Euro admission fee seems a bit much, but the stunning views over the city make up for it. After that I bumped into an Italian guy who seems to be a pretty well known scammer in the area. He is trying to lure tourists into a somewhat dodgy place called &#8220;Love Pub&#8221;. Although my ingenious plan to use his own weapons against him so he would pay for my drink didn&#8217;t work out, a good Ouzo and his disappointed face when I left without buying any drinks for him and the prosti&#8230;girls we &#8220;met&#8221; at this bar were definitely worth the 45 minutes I invested. There&#8217;s another CS meeting tomorrow and I guess it will become a late night out again. I&#8217;m glad my flight to Istanbul isn&#8217;t before 7pm on Saturday!</p>
<p>Anyway, Athens is a kickass place, with good nightlife, awesome food (go eat the Tandoori chicken wraps with freshly baked bread the Indian guy in Exarcheia sells!) and attractive people in every possible demographic group you might be interested in! I&#8217;ve only been here for a week, but I already know that I&#8217;m going to miss this place&#8230;</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had my last day of work on Monday, 44 more days till I leave Austria for a good long time. Not too many real plans yet, just a bunch of random ideas. All I know right know is that I will start in Athens from where I&#8217;ll fly to the United Arab Emirates before heading to Oman by bus. Woohoo!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend and I decided that we don&#8217;t want to spend New Year&#8217;s Eve in Vienna, so we&#8217;ve been discussing various options since last Friday. Since I couldn&#8217;t convince him to celebrate in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Tirana">Tirana</a>, we finally settled on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome">Rome</a>. So today we start hunting for tickets, find some semi-decent ones with <a href="http://www.aua.com">Austrian</a>, but somehow don&#8217;t book them right away. A couple hours pass and when we finally get our lazy butts to the online booking site, we discover that the return flight for January 2nd is gone. Anyway, a couple of mishaps and coordination problems later, I finally have tickets for December 28 and January 1st. However, when my friend tried to book the same itinerary, it turns out that the flights already became more expensive, so he didn&#8217;t book them. This is kinda awkward, since he was the one who originally wanted to go to Rome, whereas I would have been open for a lot of other options too. We&#8217;re currently discussing splitting the additional costs for his tickets, so I really hope that they will still be available at the time he tries to book them&#8230;</p>
<p>And in case you wonder: Yes, it&#8217;s the friend who was also involved in the <a href="http://blog.citizen428.net/archives/321-HOWTO-Discover-a-country-you-never-planned-seeing.html">Romania incident</a>.</p>

But it&#8217;s just not the tool for writing longer posts, and I&#8217;m missing the opportunity to get comments on my musings. So here&#8217;s how I&#8217;ll handle things from now on:<br />

<li><a href="http://blog.citizen428.net" title="">citizen428.blog</a>: Giving in to popular demand (viz. two people) this is the no frills, blog posts only side of me. I&#8217;ve also created <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/citizen428-blog">a different <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed</a> for this, so you don&#8217;t have to go through loads of pics and URLs if you are only interested in my ramblings.</li></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>The web is a great tool for sharing ideas and freedom of expression. However, efforts to try and control the Internet are growing. Internet repression is reported in countries like China, Vietnam, Tunisia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria. People are persecuted and imprisoned simply for criticising their government, calling for democracy and greater press freedom, or exposing human rights abuses, online.</em></p>
<p><em>But Internet repression is not just about governments. IT companies have helped build the systems that enable surveillance and censorship to take place. Yahoo! have supplied email usersâ€™ private data to the Chinese authorities, helping to facilitate cases of wrongful imprisonment. Microsoft and Google have both complied with government demands to actively censor Chinese users of their services.</em></p>
<p><em>Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right. It is one of the most precious of all rights. We should fight to protect it.</em><br />
