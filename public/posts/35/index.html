  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that I&#8217;m working full-time, I have to cope with only 5 weeks of holiday per year, which isn&#8217;t really much compared to the ~5 month you enjoy as an Austrian student. That&#8217;s why I decided to make the most out of it, and as my boss has already approved all of it, I can present you my holiday schedule for 2006.</p>
<p>Mid-July: Me and some friends will go to the <a href="http://www.mondialiantirazzisti.org/">Mondiali Antirazzisti</a> in Montecchio (Italy) again. What&#8217;s better than camping, beer, cocktails, sun and playing soccer all day? Not much, except maybe for the free concerts and cool parties in the evenings. Maybe we&#8217;ll also spend a day or two at the <a href="http://www.rototomsunsplash.com/">Rototom Sunsplash</a>, but that still remains to be seen.</p>
<p>September: I&#8217;ll spend three weeks in China to visit some friends in Beijing and Shanghai, some of whom I haven&#8217;t seen since my days at Tongji University. Additionally a good friend of mine will also be in China at that time, so we&#8217;re going to meet up in Beijing and crash at my former flat mate&#8217;s place for a while.</p>
<p>End of December: Once again I&#8217;ll spend the time between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s Eve in Berlin to visit the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/wiki/Suggestions#Slogan_.5BWorking_Title.5D">Chaos Communication Congres</a>. Given how great last year&#8217;s congress was (thanks again to the people who went with me, you guys have been great fun!), I&#8217;m really looking forward to this!</p>
<p>@ <a href="http://gnulords.org/~colo/serendipity/">All</a> <a href="http://teemow.com/">the</a> <a href="http://red667.org/">usual</a> <a href="http://berq.net/">suspects</a>: if you want to join me on one of those trips (or all of them for that matter), tell me at the next party or give me a call or send me a mail or a carrier pigeon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As regular reader of this blog, you should already know that the Mac Mini I&#8217;ve ordered a while ago arrived last Saturday. During the time I was <a href="http://citizen428.net/archives/268-Sure,-I-can-wait....html">waiting for the delivery</a> I already read up lots of stuff, so that I could immediately get my hands dirty once my new shiny toy arrives. Here are the first impressions of a new Mac OS X convert after one week.</p>
<p>Personally I think that the designers of OS X can&#8217;t be praised high enough. Sure, Aqua may not be everyone&#8217;s taste, but <span class="caps">IMHO</span> it&#8217;s quite nice looking and the usability is absolutely fantastic. All things you want to do work in a simple and intuitive manner without bothering you. Add stuff like <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/">Expose</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Dashboard</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a> and you&#8217;ll understand why the system is such a pleasure to work with. And that doesn&#8217;t even take into account the power that comes with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/">AppleScript</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/">Automator</a> and the available Bash shell.</p>
<p>However, where there&#8217;s light, there&#8217;s shadow. As a long-time user of various Linux distributions, I have come to appreciate the merits of centralized software repositories, where a single command like &#8220;emerge foo&#8221; or &#8220;apt-get install foo&#8221; will get me the app I want without me going to a website and downloading stuff. Now also consider the value of easy upgrades of all installed software components, and it&#8217;s obvious why a good repo is the heart of any self-respecting Linux distro. That&#8217;s something I sometimes thouroughly miss, although Mac OS X doesn&#8217;t fare to bad in this department either: Mac Update keeps the core system up to date, while most decent applications have a way to automatically upate themselfs to the newest available version. Besides that the disk images OS X apps are often distributed as are a really convenient way to try out a program before finally moving it to the &#8220;Applications&#8221; folder. Oh well, you can&#8217;t have everything I guess&#8230;</p>
<p>With Mac OS X comes the possibility to use a plethora of free (as in beer and/or speech) or commercial programs, which as far as I have seen are all of fairly high quality and do a good job of integrating with the user experience of the whole system. Now that I&#8217;ve wet your appetite, you may be quite disappointed to find out that I won&#8217;t talk about this topic right now, but will reserve this for a later blog entry. What can I say, life&#8217;s a bitch&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My Mac Mini is almost here! &#8220;Almost?&#8221;, I hear you asking? Yep, almost, because this morning when the nice lady from the logistics company who is delivering my shiny new toy called, the dialog went something like this.</p>
<p><i><br />
Me: Hello?<br />
Ms. Logistics: Hi, it&#8217;s Ms. Logistics from Foobar Logistics. I have a delivery from Apple for you!<br />
Me (silently): Finally we can take over the world, Igor. <br />
Ms. Logistic: We want to deliver it today, when will you be home?<br />
Me: Well, right after work, 6:30pm, 7:00pm to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>(That&#8217;s where Ms. Logistics showed me how good she is in producing awkward silences.)</p>
<p>Me: Lemme guess, that&#8217;s too late?<br />
Ms. Logistics: Unfortunately, yes. How about tomorrow morning?<br />
Me: Sure, morning&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll be home until about 8:45am.<br />
Ms. Logistics: Uh..ahm..<br />
Me: That&#8217;s too early then?<br />
Ms. Logistics: Yeah, I can&#8217;t promise a delivery that early [sic!]&#8230;  How about 10:00 to 10:30am.<br />
Me: Sure, who needs to go to work anyway? How about the weekend?<br />
Ms. Logistics: I&#8217;m afraid we don&#8217;t deliver on weekends&#8230;<br />
Me: Arrrghhhhhhhhhh!<br />
(Disclaimer: Wording changed for emphasis.)<br />
</i></p>
<p>Finally we agreed on a delivery on Friday afternoon, where at least my girlfriend will be home because she works for a company which &#8211; strangely enough &#8211; believes that Austrian laws regarding maxium work hours per week are to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>And the morale of the story? Try to work for a logistics company, where you&#8217;ll have immense amounts of free time, because they apparently only deliver between 10:37am and 4:23pm on even numbered days&#8230; Seriously, I&#8217;m the last person to expect anyone to work 24/7, but those times Ms. Logistics offered me just don&#8217;t work for anyone who has a regular day job.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Get rid of the day job before ordering the MacBook! ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today when my girlfriend tried to log in to one of her favourite sites to download some music she paid for, her login credentials didn&#8217;t work. When she wrote an email to the support team (after automatic retrieval of the login credentials and checking them for correctness of course), she received the following answer:</p>
<p><i><br />
Hey Silvia, many systems cannot recognize symbols in passwords. Â We have updated your profile and removed the symbol from your password Â so you should be able to successfully login to your account now.  Your new password is [snipped]<br />
[insert company name] Support<br />
</i></p>
<p>What do we learn from this?</p>
<p>1. They want to make us believe &#8220;+&#8221; is a symbol many systems can&#8217;t recognize. Sure. Besides thanks for assuming we&#8217;re too stupid to try out special characters (aka &#8220;symbols&#8221;) in the user name field after several failed log in attempts.<br />
2. They store their customer&#8217;s passwords in cleartext.<br />
3. They change user profiles without permission to avoid looking for the real problem.<br />
4. They even try to make it look like a good solution (&#8220;you should be able to succesfully login to your account now&#8221;).<br />
5. They suck like most tech supports do.</p>
<p>When I read replies like that, I really wonder how people would treat a mechanic who says &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the problem with your engine is, but many streets don&#8217;t recognize your tires so I&#8217;ve changed them. Besides that I changed your ignition lock and made a backup key for myself. All cool, eh?&#8221;.</p>
<p>My only hope: those guys obviously are dull boys, and dull boys don&#8217;t get chicks. If we&#8217;re just a little lucky, the gene pool will sort itself out.</p>
<p>P.S. Yeah, I might be a little p*ssed after spending 13 hours in the office.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not too long ago, Edward Kenworthy <a href="http://ruby-talk.org/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/179515">inquired about &#8217;Ruby&#8217;s lisp features&#8217;</a> on ruby-talk. <a href="http://ruby-talk.org/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/179642">Matz&#8217; answer</a> was as follows:</p>
<p><i>Ruby is a language designed in the following steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>take a simple lisp language (like one prior to CL).</li>
	<li>remove macros, s-expression.</li>
	<li>add simple object system (much simpler than <span class="caps">CLOS</span>).</li>
	<li>add blocks, inspired by higher order functions.</li>
	<li>add methods found in Smalltalk.</li>
	<li>add functionality found in Perl (in OO way).<br />
So, Ruby was a Lisp originally, in theory.<br />
Let&#8217;s call it MatzLisp from now on. ;-)</i><br />
Is it just me, or does that really sound like &#8220;I took a Lisp dialect, removed most of the cool stuff and added some things from other languages&#8221;? Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still think Matz has done a really amazing job when he created Ruby, and it still is one of my favourite programming languages. I just find it amazing how Lisp doesn&#8217;t have more exposure, when apparently some of the &#8220;cool&#8221; languages of today are trying hard to incorporate some of its (less powerful) features.<br /><br /></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m really interested to get some opinions on this particular topic: is there a conncection between how people perceive their own knowledge of computers and what kind of hardware they buy?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering because I&#8217;ve just been reading a discussion about the new Intel based notebooks, especially the new Mac Books which will be released in June. With 13,3&quot; it will be the smallest of Apple&#8217;s new offerings, and a lot of people have cried loud for a MacBook Pro &#8211; ok, the name really sounds stupid &#8211; with the same form factor. But will they really feel a difference? Or do they just want them because the &#8220;Pro&#8221; makes them feel better (no insult intended)? My own hardware almost always has been pretty old, and I have never much felt the need to own something better just because I&#8217;m a &#8220;power user&#8221; (periods of &#8220;decadence kills depression&#8221; excluded of course ;) ). And what&#8217;s a power user anyway?</p>
<p>When my last notebook broke, I ressurected my old desktop machine (an Athlon 650 with 320MB <span class="caps">RAM</span>). Although not blazingly fast, I was able to do everything I wanted. My computing needs may be really simple, but given that I was able to read my mails, surf the web and working/coding in several terminal windows while listening to my MP3s or web radio, why should I bother buying new hardware? The same goes for the Mac Mini which will hopefully get delivered next week: why pay a lot more money for a Core Duo, when the Core Solo is already way better than the machine I had before that and which did everything I wanted? With all the money I have already saved by not buying computers I won&#8217;t really use to their full potential anyway, I can easily buy complete new systems when I don&#8217;t want to upgrade the current ones anymore&#8230;</p>
<p>How about you guys out there? Do you buy fancy new hardware because it makes you feel &#8220;1337&#8221;? Or are you still using your 486 because as a real hacker you know how to squeeze out every percent of performance possible?</p>

I&#8217;m more cynical and bad-tempered than ever, which I guess is pretty hard for the people around me.</p>
<p>How about the other IT workers out there? Do you feel the same? And do you have any tips on how to get out of this?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, I often dream really strange dreams. But last night&#8217;s was an exceptionally funky one, which was also of the vivid kind which always leaves you pretty confused after waking up&#8230; It was set in an end of the world scenario which made the setting of Philip K. Dick&#8217;s &#8220;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&#8221; seem like a Disney theme park. There only was a small group of people &#8211; including me &#8211; left, who knew perfectly well that they were the last human beings on a dying planet. It was interesting how people coped with this knowledge, with emotions like anger, resignation and panic switching as often and rapidly as the sheets in a cheap bordello. But when finally everybody realized that there definitely was no food left on Earth (hey, who said dreams have to be realistic), nobody panicked anymore, but instead showed a strange kind of relief&#8230; And the morale of the story? If you&#8217;re interested in the movie rights, contact me before I completely forget everything.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve done it. I decided to finally get my first Mac and ordered one of those nifty new Intel Mac Minis. Since it will mainly be used for mailing, surfing the web and other things which don&#8217;t need lots of <span class="caps">CPU</span> cycles, I&#8217;ve decided to go for the Core Solo, which should be more than enough for my needs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to have a new machine to play around with, and I think I&#8217;ll have lots of fun installing Gentoo on the Mac Mini (dual boot) and giving <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/macos/">Gentoo for MacOS X</a> a try.</p>
