  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_combinator">Fixed point combinators</a> are not only an interesting mental excersise, they also e.g. allow you to implement recursion in programming languages that don&#8217;t explicitly support it. This might be slightly academic, but that doesn&#8217;t make it less fun.</p>
<p>The most well-known fixed point combinator is probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry">Haskell B. Curry&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_combinator#Y_combinator">Y combinator</a>, which will be the topic of this post. If you read <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=4825">The Little Schemer</a> &#8211; which I whole-heartedly recommend doing by the way &#8211; you already implemented it once, but if you are like me chances are you didn&#8217;t entirely get it the first time around. So when I found this nice post on <a href="http://igstan.ro/posts/2010-12-01-deriving-the-y-combinator-in-7-easy-steps.html">Deriving the Y Combinator in 7 Easy Steps</a>, I decided to &#8220;translate&#8221; it from JavaScript to Clojure.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with a &#8220;classical&#8221; recursive factorial function (while we are at it, I think factorial is a way better example for a fold than for recursion, but everybody seems to do this):<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/741070.js?file=ycombinator-step1.clj"></script></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p>Now if we wouldn&#8217;t have explicit recursion, what could we do? One solution would be to call a function with itself as an argument, then call this argument with itself as an argument and on and on until the stack blows. Not so useful. To avoid this, we write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher-order function</a> which will return a function taking a numeric argument, which will then be used to calculate the factorial:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/741070.js?file=ycombinator-step2.clj"></script><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
<p>While the above code works, all that duplicated code is really quite ugly, don&#8217;t you think? Let&#8217;s write a little helper to avoid that (I was too lazy for a proper <a href="http://richhickey.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/refer-clojure">refer-clojure</a> statement, so I decided to name the helper &#8220;yrecur&#8221; instead of &#8220;recur&#8221;):</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/741070.js?file=ycombinator-step3.clj"></script><p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p>This is better, but the double function call in the body of &#8220;fact&#8221; is still kinda ugly. Let&#8217;s hide this within another helper function called &#8220;g&#8221;,  which has to be definied inside the closure of &#8220;f&#8221; in order to be able to call this function:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/741070.js?file=ycombinator-step4.clj"></script><p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
<p>Now we are getting somewhere! To make our factorial function look almost like the original recursive version, we can factor out some code to a separate wrapper:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/741070.js?file=ycombinator-step5.clj"></script><p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
<p>Instead of actually binding our helper from step 4 to &#8220;g&#8221;, we just inline it since it&#8217;s only called once anyway:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/741070.js?file=ycombinator-step6.clj"></script><p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
<p>Last but not least we also inline the wrapper from step 5, et voila, the Y combinator:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/741070.js?file=ycombinator-step7.clj"></script></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>&#8220;We are overcome by anguish at this illogical moment of humanity.&#8221;</em> &#8212; Ernesto &#8216;Che&#8217; Guevara</p>
<p>I was born in 1979, when the world still was quite a simple place. &#8220;They&#8221; hated &#8220;us&#8221;, we hated them, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer">ozone layer</a> had no holes and we were only 21 years away from flying cars and all the other major technological advances the year 2000 promised. I was a bit too young to be aware of the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cold_War#Second_Cold_War_.281979.E2.80.9385.29">second Cold War</a>, but <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tchernobyl#Chernobyl_nuclear_reactor_disaster">1986</a> was quite a good reminder that nuclear holocaust  &#8211; even though I had only the vaguest notion of what that really means &#8211; is maybe not all that desirable. Luckily enough the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_wall">Berlin Wall</a> came down in 1989 and for a brief moment it felt like we are only a few short years away from universal peace (and flying cars).</p>
<p>The 1990s saw &#8211; amongst others &#8211; a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Gulf_War">Gulf War</a>, two wars in <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chechnya">Chechnya</a>, the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Balkan_war">Balkan Wars</a> and the one in <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Kosovo_War">Kosovo</a>. Add the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide">Rwandan genocide</a>, the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Taliban">Taliban</a> takeover of Afghanistan, the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Somali_Civil_War">Somali civil war</a> and the new nuclear arms race between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_relations">India and Pakistan</a>, and suddenly world peace didn&#8217;t seem all that likely anymore. Personally the bliss of teenage ignorance saved me from worrying too much about what was going on, so not even the lack of significant advances re flying cars didn&#8217;t seem to bother me, mostly because the 1990s already had given us one of the greatest human inventions of all times, the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/World_wide_web">World Wide Web</a>. The world was becoming smaller every day and suddenly you could interact with people from all over the planet, chat, play, laugh and cry together. Surely this would facilitate mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the year 2010: <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/September_11_attacks">9/11</a> led to the wars in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_war">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_war">Iraq</a>, religious fundamentalists <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Intelligent_design">are able to change school curricula</a> and civil liberties get cut down left and right as a result of the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror">war on terror</a>&quot;. I can&#8217;t talk for anyone else here, but for me that&#8217;s a rather sad and crazy state of affairs. Sure, we have made enormous technological advances, and when you look at things like life expectancy and <span class="caps">GDP</span>, the world is in a better shape than it ever was. But when I look around me, what I see is not what I imagined the world of 2010 to be like when I was a kid. What I do see is an absurd mix of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_book">1984</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_new_world">Brave New World</a>, where the largest communist country has to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_economic_crisis">save capitalism</a>, the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_Europe">Fortress Europe</a>&quot; is becoming a reality and governments are working against their citizens instead of for them: torture is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_of_torture_in_recent_times">en vogue again</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship">censorship</a> is portrayed as a necessary evil to combat child pornography and terrorism, students have to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_student_protests_in_Austria">fight for proper education</a> and downloading a movie can get you a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-piracy#Examples">jail sentence</a>. We also have an &#8220;us&#8221; vs &#8220;them&#8221; situation again, just this time it&#8217;s mostly based on religion. And whenever there is the promise of paradise, life down here seems to turn into hell. I&#8217;d rather have the cold war back, because in retrospect people who fight over ideology seem a lot less likely to blow the whole place to smithereens than the ones who fight over religion.</p>
<p>I see this, and sometimes I feel paralyzed. But you know what, it&#8217;s mostly our fault. Wars need people to fight them, gods need people to believe in them and governments get overthrown by them. Why is it that we so happily do the first two, but seem to have trouble with the latter? Twitter is not a revolution and reposting stuff on your tumblelog is not a form of political protest. And no, the irony of writing a blog post about this is not lost on me. I just don&#8217;t know what else to do.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s about time that we all take a step back and a deep breath and fucking do something: Educate yourself! Go and learn about different cultures, different ways of life and the history of current conflicts. Don&#8217;t rely on a single source of information, but double check, triple check, question everything and try to form your own opinion. Go vote! You don&#8217;t like any party? Join one and try to change it, or start your own. When you have to, go to the streets to protest. Don&#8217;t buy into someone else&#8217;s dream, but try to live your own! It&#8217;s hard, especially compared to sitting around and complaining, but it may be worth it. Stop the world from becoming smaller again! Every so often, remind yourself that the web is not only a distribution medium for cat pictures, but also a tool for knowledge transfer and change. This is more a reminder to myself than advice for anyone else.</p>
<p>So where&#8217;s our future? In us! And it&#8217;s about time we all overcome our collective apathy and do something about it, otherwise we don&#8217;t need a Mayan calendar to end the world for us, we seem perfectly capable of doing that on our own.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Synopsis:</strong><br />
<a href="http://createyourproglang.com/">Create Your Own Programming Language</a> by Marc-Andre Cournoyer is a guide on &#8211; surprise &#8211; creating your own programming language, consisting of a 53 page <span class="caps">PDF</span>, exercises and solutions, a toy language written in Ruby and a more full-featured one hosted on the <span class="caps">JVM</span>. There&#8217;s also a 10 minute long screencast on extending the latter, as well as an <a href="http://createyourproglang.com/community/">online community</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The author:</strong><br />
Hailing from Montreal, Marc-Andre is no stranger, especially if you are a Rubyist. Some of his notable projects include the web server <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a>, the Ruby interpreter <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/tinyrb/">tinyrb</a> and the web site <a href="RefactorMyCode.com">Refactor My Code</a>. He also co-founded a company and is now <span class="caps">CTO</span> of another one.</p>
<p><strong>The book:</strong><br />
Obviously 53 pages are not enough to teach you everything about writing your own production-ready programming language, but that&#8217;s also not what the author advertises. What you do get is a quite well-made little <span class="caps">PDF</span>, explaining all the important components &#8211; lexer, parser, interpreter, runtime model, compiler and virtual machine &#8211; of a toy language called &#8220;Awesome&#8221;, which is basically a subset of Ruby with Python-style indentation.</p>
<p>After the introduction, all chapters follow the same basic structure. First a brief introduction of the topic at hand, including pointers to well established projects like <a href="http://flex.sourceforge.net/manual/">Flex</a>, <a href="http://www.complang.org/ragel/">Ragel</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">Bison</a> or <a href="http://llvm.org/"><span class="caps">LLVM</span></a>. After that you&#8217;ll find some well-documented and easy to understand Ruby code, implementing what you just learned about. Chapters finish with small exercises, e.g. implementing the WhileNode in the interpreter or adding inheritance to the runtime. In the end there are some parting thoughts on topics like homoiconicity and self-hosting, as well as a resources section including pointers to events, forums, blogs and notable languages. If you are a language geek there&#8217;s probably not much new here, but it&#8217;s a nice addition. Last but not least you&#8217;ll find solutions to the exercises. Once you came this far you can dive into the <span class="caps">JVM</span> language and experiment with extending it.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
Would I recommend this book? That depends on what you are looking for. If you want a detailed academic text, <a href="http://createyourproglang.com/">Create Your Own Programming language</a> is definitely not for you. Likewise if you already implemented your own language or have a good idea about what&#8217;s involved in doing so, there are also better books to spend your money on. If however you are looking for a fun quick intro to the topic, including easy to understand and well-document code, as well as the right terms to feed into your preferred search engine, this might just be what you are looking for, but you&#8217;ll have to decide if you are willing to spend US$40 on that, which I personally find a bit too steep.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_International_Film_Festival">Viennale</a> has finished, time for a little recap of the five movies we saw this year:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637694/">Los labios</a> (Ivan Fund &amp; Santiago Loza)<br>
This had potential, but didn&#8217;t really live up to it. Usually I&#8217;m all for mixing professional and amateur actors, but in this case it didn&#8217;t work for me. A documentary on this topic would probably haven been more interesting.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156173/">Vincere</a> (Marco Bellocchio)<br>
Probably my favorite movie of this year&#8217;s festival. An interesting &#8211; and true &#8211; story, great acting and beautiful presentation, what more can you ask for?</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1639901/">Un homme qui crie</a> (Mahamat-Saleh Haroun)<br />
A solid movie about present-day Chad. Told in a very dry manner, I really enjoyed the first half of this, but found it a bit of a drag towards the end. The lead actor was great though!</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1522857/">The Oath</a> (Laura Poitras)<br />
A documentary about two men from Yemen who worked for Osama Bin Laden. I found this very interesting and as always it&#8217;s good to hear the other side of a story.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1424053/">Engkwentro</a> (Pepe Diokno)<br>
The life of two brothers in a ghetto somewhere in the Philippine &#8211; violence, drugs and gangs. This seems to have been made with a fairly low budget, and the nervous handheld camera may upset some people. Overall it was pretty interesting though and I&#8217;m glad we saw this.</li>
