  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Internet: the final frontier. These are the voyages of citizen428. His mission: to explore strange net worlds; to seek out new forms of communication and new communities; to boldly go where no man has gone before.</em></p>
<p>Now what do I want to tell you with this rip-off Star Trek intro? The answer is pretty simple: I just love the Internet! Since my first contact with the medium around 1993/94 when I was around 14 it really fascinated me. Nowadays I&#8217;ve mostly abandoned stuff like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBSes</a> and am more focussed on the <span class="caps">WWW</span>, which more often than not makes me spend more time online than is really good for me. Where this fascination comes from I can&#8217;t really tell, but I supposse it has to do with the enormous possibilities the web has to offer: you can find nearly all the <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">information</a> you want, build <a href="http://www.cargal.org/">online communities</a> or <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">communicate</a> with friends everywhere in the world in real-time. Webzines and blogging have in some cases become a valuable alternative to traditional media and additionally the <span class="caps">WWW</span> has taught quite a lot of people some things about freedom of expression, and how important it is to stand up and fight for your rights. At least that&#8217;s what I want to believe. Now that this intro got a lot longer than I originally intended, let&#8217;s get to the things I really wanted to tackle in this entry.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s summer and lots of people love to go surfing. While some go to Hawaii or Portugal, others will  go to the club house of one of the projects I&#8217;m involved in, to surf the web on one of the two shiny new surf stations. Ok, that probably was the lamest introduction I&#8217;ve ever posted here, so let&#8217;s get it on with the technical stuff, seems like I&#8217;m better at that&#8230;</p>
<p>Things started when <a href="http://www.xn--friedhofstribne-cwb.at/fht/index.jsp">we</a> got donated some old Compaq PCs and decided that they will get used as surf stations for the club house. Being old Pentium IIs in the 200 something MHz Range with 3GB hard disks they surely don&#8217;t make you want to scream in ecstasy, but they aren&#8217;t too shabby either. Unfortunately they don&#8217;t have CD-<span class="caps">ROM</span> drives and their design also doesn&#8217;t really allow for them. <br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to another issue of &#8220;citizen428&#8217;s random tidbits&#8221;!</p>
<p>Some days ago I&#8217;ve watched a really great documentary called <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A//www.skinheadattitude.com/&amp;ei=frv0QsOzIczcQr-YvfAN">Skinhead Attitude</a> by Daniel Schweizer. I especially recommend this movie to all people who merely associate Skinheads with stupid right-wing Boneheads, and know nothing about the history of the movement which already lasts for more than 40 years.</p>
<p><i>Skinhead Attitude outlines 40 years of the skinhead movement, from its origins in Jamaica to its current manifestation in present day Britain. By following Karole, a modern skinhead girl with a traditional and anti-racist attitude, the film powerfully draws a portrait of an often maligned group. Concentrating on the left-wing rather than the usual right-wing extremists who are often so readily associated with skinheads, the film describes the transformation and radicalisation of this subculture of youth. Including interviews and music from Bad Manners, Sham 69 and The Oppressed, Skinhead Attitude is a revealing and comprehensive look at a misinterpreted and misunderstood subculture.</i> (<a href="http://www.leedsfilm.com/2004/liff/film/667">Link</a>).</p>
<p>As Ska music is one of the cornerstones of Skinhead culture, this movie also sports a pretty cool soundtrack and has some nice live sequences of bands like Bad Manners, The Oppressed or <a href="http://www.losfastidios.com/">Los Fastidios</a>.  Finally here&#8217;s some suggested reading for people who want to know more about this fascinating subculture: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinhead">Wikipedia:Skinhead</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska">Wikipedia:Ska</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oi%21">Wikipedia:Oi!</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARP">Wikipedia:<span class="caps">SHARP</span></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Fascist_Action">Wikipedia:Anti-Fascist Action</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1903854229/qid=1123336475/sr=8-3/ref=pd_bbs_sbs_3/103-2685163-0146210?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">No Retreat: The Secret War Between Britain&#8217;s Anti-Fascists and the Far Right</a> (we&#8217;ve met co-author Steve Titzey at this year&#8217;s Mondiali Anti Razzisti in Montecchio).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://wiki.whatthehack.org/index.php/Main_Page">What the Hack</a> is over since Sunday, and I finally feel like writing about this great event, which so far definitely was my personal highlight of this summer. A big &#8220;Thank you!&#8221; goes to everyone who made this event possible, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed these 3 days with interesting lectures, nice people and an overall great atmosphere. Special thanks go to Gentoo user and travel compagnion <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=44722">Red B@ron</a> who regularly lent me his laptop (yep, mine&#8217;s still broken) as well as <a href="http://www.teemow.de/">teemow</a> who told me about quite some cool stuff, including <a href="http://www.plazes.com/">Plazes</a> and who incidentally is also a Gentoo user.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t meet any other Gentoo devs at the event, can it really be that besides me and <a href="http://www.hboeck.de/">Hanno</a> nobody made it to the event? If that&#8217;s really the case it&#8217;s a shame, as <span class="caps">WTH</span> really was a good mixture of interesting technical and social lectures, as well as a good chance to meet nice people. It surely boosted my motivation to work on <span class="caps">FOSS</span> projects (including Gentoo of course) even more, so it definitely was worth the trip for me.</p>
<p>And now for some comments on the talks I&#8217;ve seen:</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As most of you <span class="caps">GNOME</span> lovers out there will know, release 2.12 of our favourite desktop is due on September 7th, 2005.  If you are like me and can hardly wait for this new version, have a look at the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~davyd/gnome-2-12/">prerelease tour</a> that <span class="caps">GNOME</span> Applets maintainer Davyd Madeley has ready for us. There you&#8217;ll find quite a few nifty things, the most interesting for me were the integration of GTK+ 2.8 with the <a href="http://cairographics.org/introduction">Cairo</a> vector graphics engine, further integration of the <a href="http://hal.freedesktop.org/wiki/">Hardware Abstraction Layer</a> and improvements on <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/totem/">Totem&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> backend as well as the development of a Totem Mozilla plugin. As I don&#8217;t use (or even install that is) Evolution and Epiphany, I don&#8217;t really care about them, but it seems they&#8217;re getting some nice features too, as is Nautilus, another application I hardly use for more than displaying desktop icons. There are also quite some really nice minor and cosmetic changes detailed in this preview, which surely will further enhance the great usability of the <span class="caps">GNOME</span> desktop. As it seems there won&#8217;t be too many new applications in this release, which I think is pretty cool, as I&#8217;m a person who doesn&#8217;t want to install everything plus the kitchen sink with my desktop (that&#8217;s why I use custom ebuilds, thanks to the wonders of Gentoo ;) ). However, the really nice <span class="caps">PDF</span> and PS reader <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">Evince</a> will finally replace <span class="caps">GGV</span> and <span class="caps">GPDF</span>, which <span class="caps">IMHO</span> is a Good Thing&#8482;.</p>
<p>So much for this prerelease tour of <span class="caps">GNOME</span> 2.12, but I have some more cool apps for you! Have you ever been looking for a comfortable editor for changing the tags of your music collection and  finally went back to <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/id3ed/">id3ed</a> on the command line because all the graphical apps just wouldn&#8217;t cut it? Well, now that there&#8217;s <a href="http://more-cowbell.org/">Cowbell</a>, it seems like there&#8217;s one thing less to worry about, as this tag editor for our preferred desktop doesn&#8217;t only look nice, it also integrates with the Amazon Web Services <span class="caps">SOAP</span> interface and does most of the work for you automatically. As most of the cool new apps I ran across lately, Cowbell is written using Mono and <span class="caps">GTK</span>#. The same holds true for <a href="http://diva.mdk.org.pl/about/">Diva</a> (except for the libGdv core engine which is written in C), a project which aims at creating &#8220;<i>a decent, lean&amp;mean video editing solution for the Linux/Unix platform</i>&#8221;. There&#8217;s not too much to <a href="http://diva.mdk.org.pl/category/screenshots/">see</a> yet, but personally I&#8217;d love to get a decent video editing solution for my Linux desktop, so all the power to the <span class="caps">DIVA</span> developers! Maybe you also want to check out <a href="http://seahorse.sourceforge.net/">Seahorse</a>, which despite not being written in Mono/C# is pretty cool too. It&#8217;s a nice <span class="caps">GNOME</span> frontend for <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a>, which I&#8217;ve installed quite a while ago and which has released a new version less than a week ago. Although I don&#8217;t really have any need for it (long live the GnuPG command line!), I think everything that makes privacy technologies accessible to the non-techy folk needs our fullest support. So go grab Seahorse, test it, find and report bugs and show it to your friends. This surely will make you really attractive for whichever demographic group you want to be attractive for*!</p>
<I>*<b>Note:</b> This may be just a blatant lie, but you have to find out for yourself.</i></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After coming back from <a href="http//www.whatthehack.org">What The Hack</a> I was full of energy and new ideas, so I decided to redesign my blog a little.</p>
<p>As you can see I haven&#8217;t only updated to the newest version of <a href="http://s9y.org">Serendipity</a>, but I&#8217;ve also switched to the <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/">Kubrick</a>  template that so many people <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/archives05/2005/05/the-scourge-of-kubrick">seem</a> <a href="http://www.c3w.de/2005/03/06/kubrick-suckt.html">to</a> <a href="http://www.das-netzbuch.de/article/2181/nieder-mit-kubrick">hate</a>. I really couldn&#8217;t care less, because I&#8217;m going to adapt the <span class="caps">CSS</span> to my own liking pretty soon. Up until then you theoretically could bitch about this boring design, but I think the template provides a clear and reasonably stylish look so I won&#8217;t listen to you.</p>
<p>What else is new? I&#8217;ve moved all the plugins to the right column and rearranged them a little, added a plugin to show some of my <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> links as well as another one for random quotes, and reformatted most of the old entries because I got rid of a certain markup plugin that got on my nerves too much. There&#8217;s been some other minor tweaks like finally incorporating a <a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati</a> ping, but finding those is left as an exercise to the reader&#8230;</p></div>

<p><i><b>Data retention is no solution!</b></p>
<p>The European ministers of Justice and the European Commission want to keep all telephone and internet traffic data of all 450 million Europeans. If you are concerned about this plan, please sign the petition.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with data retention? The proposal to retain traffic data will reveal who has been calling and e-mailing whom, what websites people have visited and even where they were with their mobile phones. Telephone companies and internet services providers would be ordered to store all traffic data of their customers. Police and intelligence agencies in Europe would be granted access the traffic data. Various, competing proposals in Brussels mention retention periods from 6 months up to four years.</p>
<p>Data retention is an invasive tool that interferes with the private lives of all 450 million people in the European Union. Data retention is a policy that expands powers of surveillance in an unprecedented manner. It simultaneously revokes many of the safeguards in European human rights instruments, such as the Data Protection Directives and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>Data retention means that governments may interfere with your private life and private communications regardless if you are suspected of a crime or not.</p>
<p><b>Data retention is not a solution to terrorism and crime!</b></p>
<p>In July 2005 the European Parliament adopted a report by Parliament member Alexander Alvaro on the mandatory data retention plan. The report concludes that the proposal is disproportionate. The report also questions the necessity, effectiveness and high costs for industry and telecommunication users.</p>
<p>No research has been conducted anywhere in Europe that supports the need and necessity of creating such a large-scale database containing such sensitive data for the purpose of fighting crime and terrorism.</p>
<p>The attacks on London are an attack on human rights. The protection of those human rights matters most when governments and societies face times of crisis. The worst possible response would be to jeopardise those carefully wrought rights by a panic-inspired response. A mass surveillance response to terror would result in a resounding success for the perpetrators of these attacks: a fundamental undermining of our most fundamental values.</p>
<p><b>What can you do to stop this plan?</b></p>
<p>If you are concerned about the European plans for data retention, please sign the petition and alert as many people as you can to support this campaign.</p>
<p>The signatures will be sent to the European Commission and the European Parliament.</i>&quot;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Saturday I went to a really nice <a href="http://5uper.net/post/116">release party</a> at the Viennese <a href="http://www.mqw.at/">Museumsquartier</a>. It didn&#8217;t only feature free Caipirinhas, but also attracted a somewhat techy crowd, which not only gave me ample opportunity to advertise Gentoo and Ruby (<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> in particular, as most people seem very interested in it), but also to discuss some interesting stuff with a package maintainer for the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Trustix</a> distribution. As there seems to be quitre some interest, I will probably give an introduction to Ruby at the very same location in August or September! :)</p>
<p>Next thing on my list is a pretty neat tip for all you <a href="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/">Liferea</a> lovers out there: If you want to subscribe to the <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/">Atom</a> feed Google provides for your Gmail inbox, all you have to do is to add a new feed, where you choose &#8220;Command&#8221; as source type. In the dialog that pops up just enter this line <div class='bogus-wrapper'><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>curl -s -u username:password https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div> and from now on you can follow your Gmail account from your favourite newsreader! <I>Disclaimer: Yes, this tip was blatantly stolen from the <a href="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/faq.htm">Liferea <span class="caps">FAQ</span></a>. Speaking from experience most people don&#8217;t read documentation, so I thought this might be useful here.</i></p>
<p>Finally I just wanted to say that I&#8217;ll be at <a href="http://www.whatthehack.org/">What The Hack</a> from Wednesday evening to Sunday, where I hope to meet lots of fellow Gentooists, especially the guys from the &#8220;German conspiracy&#8221; I already know!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As recent surveys have shown I haven&#8217;t blogged in over two month. That&#8217;s quite a long time even for my standards, and I have no one to blame for this lack of communications besides myself (believe me, I really tried to find a scapegoat).</p>
<p>True, my dear old laptop is still broken, but there&#8217;s my trustworthy Athlon 650 desktop that currently serves as my main computer. For all of you who wonder what I&#8217;ve been up to lately, here&#8217;s a short overview of what I spent my time on over the last few weeks.<br />
