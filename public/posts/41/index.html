  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, today my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596007922/qid=1124917941/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4699908-2098445?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Mono: A Developer&#8217;s Notebook</a> finally arrived! I ordered this book because I&#8217;m a fan of <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a> pretty much since I&#8217;ve first heard about it, and examples like this <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~edasque/projects/Tutorial/glade2.html">tutorial on writing a web browser</a> show that the framework is quite capable. Additionally there are all this cool new <span class="caps">GNOME</span> apps like Blam!, Beagle, f-spot, Tomboy etc., that demonstrate the possibilites of Mono.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I ordered this book that has gotten pretty good reviews everywhere and which was modelled after the important <span class="caps">FOSS</span> mantra &#8220;Show me the code!&#8221;. Instead of long-winded syntactical explanations, the author uses lots of annotated examples to get his point across. I hope that this weekend I&#8217;ll have some free time to get started with reading&#8230;. :)</p>
<p>A last note: it&#8217;s incredibly cool that Amazon gives you the possibility to buy books from alternative   dealers via their site! I can go to Amazon, look for the books I&#8217;m interested in, read the reviews etc. and then compare if it may be cheaper to buy this book somewhere else. And if it really is, I can still buy the book as if I would have bought it from Amazon. But guess what? Of all the books I&#8217;ve ordered there, only 2 so far were from alternative dealers, because most of the time the extra shipment costs make the book more expensive than the ad itself makes you believe. But for the &#8220;Developer&#8217;s Notebook&#8221; it really made sense to buy it from <a href="http://caiman.com/">Caiman</a>, because it was not only cheaper, I also got the book after 7 days (from Florida!) compared to 10 to 13 days Amazon.de states as delivery time for this article.</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;m tired. My English probably sucks because of that. Live with it.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As most of us know, MS Word isn&#8217;t really suited for long and complex documents. I&#8217;ve heard things got better with recent releases, but judging from the experiences of others, it still pretty much sucks in some respects&#8230;</p>
<p>Now that I will soon start with my diploma thesis, I obviously spent some time thinking about the tool I will use to write it. As all my current machines only run <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> or some flavor of <a href="http://www.bsd.org/"><span class="caps">BSD</span></a>, Word was definitely not an option (it never really was one anway). After some considertation, I came to the conclusion that this is the perfect opportunity to finally teach myself some <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. I&#8217;ve done some research already and found useful stuff like <a href="http://www.komascript.de/"><span class="caps">KOMA</span>-Script</a>. Now one big question remains: which editor/<span class="caps">IDE</span> shall be used? Here are the contestants:<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, I&#8217;ve done it again. Another redesign. Guilty as charged. This is the forth layout since I started this blog and the third in the last 3 weeks. Here&#8217;s a little recap of all the designs:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>MT &#8211; Trendy</strong>: A nice design by Sebastian Bergmann, but after a while it just got on my nerves too much and I can&#8217;t even say why.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Kubrick 1.2.6 port</strong>: After I got tired of my initial layout, I switched over to the Kubrick port done by Tom Sommer. I still think that Kubrick actually is a rather nice layout, but so do lots of other people, which is the reason you can see this theme everywhere&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Blogger-Tabacco</strong>: Done by Frédéric Wenzel, I tweaked the <span class="caps">CSS</span> a little to get the background image to the right and was pretty happy with the look. But after a really short period I realized that although I liked the colors and all, the design wasn&#8217;t &#8220;me&#8221; somehow&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The current design</strong>: initially based on the template &#8220;Joshua&#8221; by Hendrik Scholz, I&#8217;ve changed the <span class="caps">CSS</span> quite a lot already. Not only did I create my own banner graphic using <a href="http://fyre.navi.cx/">Fyre</a>, I also tweaked the colors to my liking and completely redid the sidebar as I didn&#8217;t like the one &#8220;Joshua&#8221; had to offer. There will be some more minor adjustments to the <span class="caps">CSS</span>, but otherwise, this is it, the new look of citizen428.net!</li>
</ul>
<p>Please post any comments, desing proposals etc. that you might have as a comment, thanks!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p align="center"><img src="http://religionsfreie-zone.de/zone.jpg" alt="Heidenspaß statt Höllenquallen" /></a><br />
<br />
For the last few days the pope&#8217;s visit at the <a href="http://www.wjt2005.de/">Weltjugendtag</a> in Cologne is dominating German speaking media. If you look at how the participants celebrate &#8220;the vicar of Peter&#8221;, you&#8217;d almost believe that The Beatles are on tour again&#8230; I even did see a laola wave on TV! What were this guys chanting while doing this? I suppose something along the lines of &#8220;Give me an I! I! Give me a N! N! &#8230; So what&#8217;s the word? <span class="caps">INQUISITION</span>! Horray!&#8221; would have done the trick. When I saw all this religious hysteria, I nearly got afraid that in some years time secularism will only be a fond memory and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism">creationists</a> will try to take over the European school system&#8230;.  Finally I found a link to this <a href="http://religionsfreie-zone.de/">platform</a> in <a href="http://www.teemow.com/2005/08/20/blessms/">teemow&#8217;s blog</a>, which tells me that I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks that the enlightenment was one of the better episodes in recent human history&#8230;  Or maybe I just haven&#8217;t seen the light, and the pope is here to reinstall Edmund Stoiber as emperor by God&#8217;s grace, after which millions of Germans will do laola waves, singing &#8220;habemus papam&#8221; and &#8220;Wir sind Papst!&#8221;. And in the digital age, Canossa is only an election pledge away&#8230;<br />
<br />
<i>Note: I really respect religion and people&#8217;s religious believes, as long as those people in return respect my agnostic and critical approach to religion. Believe in anything you want, be it God, Buddha, Krishna or some stones in the desert. I really couldn&#8217;t care less, but don&#8217;t try to force your believes on me and try to stay in touch with recent (e.g. no older than say, 200 years) scientific developments.</i></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No, this is not about a certain patchset for the kernel sources, so you can get your blood pressure down again. Instead it&#8217;s about &#8220;an efficient, yet simple engine for developing professional Web Applications using the Ruby language&#8221; (quoted from <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/nitro/">Rubyforge</a>).</p>
<p>I know, this sounds a lot like the much hyped <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, but <a href="http://nitrohq.com/">Nitro</a> definitely is diffent!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you can see, I&#8217;ve once again changed the template I&#8217;m using for my blog. As I&#8217;ve told you before the Kubrick port was only a temporary solution, but it got on my nerves faster than I expected. There are just too many sites using it&#8230;</p>
<p>I now use a style called &#8220;Blogger-Tabacco&#8221; by <a href="blog.magenson.de">Frédéric Wenzel</a>, which I think looks pretty cool. I&#8217;ve changed the <span class="caps">CSS</span> to better suit my taste though: the image initially was on the left, but I thought this interferes too much with the main content. I therefore put it on the right and switched it horizontally. After this I had to move the header a little, otherwise the top left corner would have been way too empty.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m pretty happy with the new look, although there are still a few more tweaks I want to apply to the stylesheet. I guess this template will stay a little longer than the last one, but who knows what mood I&#8217;m in next week&#8230; ;)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The wonders of <span class="caps">FOSS</span>: jabber4r is a Jabber library for Ruby, which has seen its last release in early March 2004. As the package seemed to have problems with newer (&gt;=1.8.2) versions of Ruby, I refrained from adding it to the tree. Well, at least until today, when my Rubyforge tracker informed me that jabber4r-0.8.0 has just been released. It&#8217;s in <span class="caps">CVS</span> already, so it soon should be available on a mirror near you. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Also new to the tree is <span class="caps">PDF</span>::Writer, a library that allows you to create PDFs from Ruby. Sounds cool? It sure is! Go check out the <a href="http://ruby-pdf.rubyforge.org/pdf-writer/demos/index.html">demos</a> if you don&#8217;t believe me&#8230;</p>
<p>Also some <a href="http://www.leyrer.priv.at/martin/">kind soul</a> informed me that yesterday I posted a wrong link to my Gentoo related ta-da list, so here&#8217;s the correct <span class="caps">URL</span>: <a href="http://citizen428.tadalist.com/lists/public/95952">http://citizen428.tadalist.com/lists/public/95952</a>. I also updated my original post with the correct address.</p>
<p>The last paragraph of this blog goes out to all the Gentoo/FreeBSD developers, especially <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~flameeyes/">Flameeyes</a> who submitted a comment to my last entry: if you need anything added to the <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~citizen428/doc/gentoo-freebsd.html">Gentoo/FreeBSD guide</a>, just send me an email with the desired content and I&#8217;ll update the doc <span class="caps">ASAP</span>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t posted on Planet Gentoo for a rather long time, so before anyone thinks that I&#8217;m <span class="caps">MIA</span> again, I thought I&#8217;d better post a little update.</p>
<p>1. I left the games herd. Nobody there will probably miss me, as I never found the time to do more than adding some small games (try <a href="http://home.kcore.de/~kiza/linux/tornado">Tornado</a>!) and <a href="http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=xgame">games-util/xgame</a> to the tree.</p>
<p>2. I&#8217;m currently trying to clean out the Ruby herd&#8217;s bug list. I&#8217;ve finally added some long overdue packages to the tree and set up Rubyforge monitoring so I won&#8217;t forget about them in the future and will try to poke some people to get some of our other old bugs closed.</p>
<p>3. Over the next few days I&#8217;m going to add <a href="http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/">ruby-gnome2-0.13.0</a> to the tree. It&#8217;s not exactly a fun process, as I&#8217;ve learned when I did the version bump to 0.12.0&#8230; While I&#8217;m at it, I also want to add <a href="http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Gtk%3A%3AMozEmbed">ruby-gtkmozembed</a> and ruby-gtktrayicon, which currently aren&#8217;t a part of the official ruby-gnome2 releases.</p>
<p>4. I created a <a href="http://citizen428.tadalist.com/lists/public/95952">shared ta-da list</a> for my Gentoo work, so everyone can see which packages are next on my list to get added to the tree etc. If you are really interested in being able to edit this list, just send an email to citizen428@g.o so I can add you to the trusted people who are allowed to do just this (<span class="caps">NOTE</span>: this offer only concerns people who have a mail adress ending in @gentoo.org, sorry guys).</p>
<p>5. I&#8217;ve done German longdescriptions for all the category metadata.xml files which got added since I first went on a translation spree (except for sci-*, which were done by Kugelfang).</p>
<p>Last but not least here&#8217;s an old but still good article called <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/content/view/1014/2218/">Extending Vim with Ruby</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Internet: the final frontier. These are the voyages of citizen428. His mission: to explore strange net worlds; to seek out new forms of communication and new communities; to boldly go where no man has gone before.</em></p>
<p>Now what do I want to tell you with this rip-off Star Trek intro? The answer is pretty simple: I just love the Internet! Since my first contact with the medium around 1993/94 when I was around 14 it really fascinated me. Nowadays I&#8217;ve mostly abandoned stuff like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBSes</a> and am more focussed on the <span class="caps">WWW</span>, which more often than not makes me spend more time online than is really good for me. Where this fascination comes from I can&#8217;t really tell, but I supposse it has to do with the enormous possibilities the web has to offer: you can find nearly all the <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">information</a> you want, build <a href="http://www.cargal.org/">online communities</a> or <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">communicate</a> with friends everywhere in the world in real-time. Webzines and blogging have in some cases become a valuable alternative to traditional media and additionally the <span class="caps">WWW</span> has taught quite a lot of people some things about freedom of expression, and how important it is to stand up and fight for your rights. At least that&#8217;s what I want to believe. Now that this intro got a lot longer than I originally intended, let&#8217;s get to the things I really wanted to tackle in this entry.</div>
