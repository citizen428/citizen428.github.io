  <div class="entry-content"><p>When deciding to switch from Wordpress to Octopress one of the main reasons was that I don&rsquo;t need most of the advanced features the former offers. However, for my weekly <a href="http://citizen428.net/blog/categories/informationoverload/">Information Overload</a> series I relied on two features, namely templates and scheduling: I created a new post from the template and then filled it with content over the week. Once I was done I&rsquo;d schedule it for publishing on Sunday afternoon. Here&rsquo;s how I plan to do this with Octopress.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> as my blogging engine
of choice for over a year (after moving away from <a href="http://s9y.org/">S9Y</a>), I decided to switch this site to
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. Why? Because it&rsquo;s cool!
No, seriously. I was actually quite happy with WP, it just always felt
like way more than I actually needed. OP on the other hand is super
lightweight, ritten in Ruby and uses some of my favorite technologies,
like Sinatra and Markdown. It doesn&rsquo;t stop there though: having the site rendered to static
files means I can get rid of MySQL and PHP on my little VPS, which
definitely is a plus. And it&rsquo;s also very cool to have all your posts
in a directory on your local file system, so you can use all your
favorite command line tools to search through or batch modify
them. Last but not least I&rsquo;m now writing my posts in Emacs instead of
some crappy web input form (ok, granted, I could have done that before
too).</p>

<p>Now to the actual migration. I started by exporting my WP blog to
XML. This can be done in the administration backend under &ldquo;Tools &ndash;
Export&rdquo;. Once I had this XML, I used the following script to convert
the posts to individual files for Octopress:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1240781.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>require &#39;fileutils&#39;
require &#39;date&#39;
require &#39;yaml&#39;
require &#39;rexml/document&#39;

include REXML

doc = Document.new(File.new(ARGV[0]))

FileUtils.mkdir_p &quot;_posts&quot;

doc.elements.each(&quot;rss/channel/item[wp:status = &#39;publish&#39; and wp:post_type = &#39;post&#39;]&quot;) do |e|
  p e.elements[&#39;wp:post_name&#39;].text
  post = e.elements
  slug = post[&#39;wp:post_name&#39;].text
  date = DateTime.parse(post[&#39;wp:post_date&#39;].text)
  name = &quot;%02d-%02d-%02d-%s.textile&quot; % [date.year, date.month, date.day, slug]
  date_string = &quot;#{date.year}-#{date.month}-#{date.day}&quot;

  # convert all tags and categories into categories
  categories = []
  post.each(&#39;category&#39;) do |cat|
    categories &lt;&lt; cat.text
  end

  content = post[&#39;content:encoded&#39;].text.encode(&quot;UTF-8&quot;)

  # convert &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt; blocks to {% codeblock %}{% encodebloc %}
  #content = content.gsub(/&lt;code&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/code&gt;/, &#39;`\1`&#39;)
  content = content.gsub(/&lt;code&gt;/, &#39;{% codeblock %}&#39;)
  content = content.gsub(/&lt;\/code&gt;/, &#39;{% endcodeblock %}&#39;)

  # convert &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; blocks to {% codeblock %}{% encodebloc %}
  #content = content.gsub(/&lt;pre lang=&quot;([^&quot;]*)&quot;&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/pre&gt;/m, &#39;`\1`&#39;)
  content = content.gsub(/&lt;pre&gt;/, &#39;{% codeblock %}&#39;)
  content = content.gsub(/&lt;pre lang=&quot;([^&quot;]*)&quot;&gt;/, &#39;{% codeblock %}&#39;)
  content = content.gsub(/&lt;\/pre&gt;/m, &#39;{% endcodeblock %}&#39;)

  # convert headers
  (1..3).each do |i|
    content = content.gsub(/&lt;h#{i}&gt;([^&lt;]*)&lt;\/h#{i}&gt;/, (&#39;#&#39;*i) + &#39; \1&#39;)
  end

  puts &quot;Converting: #{name}&quot;

  data = {
    &#39;layout&#39; =&gt; &#39;post&#39;,
    &#39;title&#39; =&gt; post[&#39;title&#39;].text,
    &#39;date&#39; =&gt; date_string,
    &#39;comments&#39; =&gt; true,
    &#39;categories&#39; =&gt; categories,
  }.delete_if { |k,v| v.nil? || v == &#39;&#39;}.to_yaml

  File.open(&quot;_posts/#{name}&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) do |f|
    f.puts data
    f.puts &quot;---&quot;
    f.puts content
  end

end
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This was a fork of
<a href="https://gist.github.com/1240781/ac8a139bf73232c4333f0cc5734151cf8e5d1f87">another script</a>,
but tailored for my specific needs (e.g. all tags and categories of a
post were converted to categories and I exported the files to Textile
instead of Markdown because I used the former in my WP install through
a plugin).</p>

<p>Since some of my posts are quite popular and get linked to a lot, I
didn&rsquo;t want to loose my old links. I therefore wrote another script
that created 301 redirects for all of them:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1241762.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>require &#39;date&#39;
require &#39;rexml/document&#39;

include REXML

doc = Document.new(File.new(ARGV[0]))
format = ARGV[1] || &quot;apache&quot;

formats = {
  :apache =&gt; &quot;RewriteRule ^%s$ /%s [R=301,L]&quot;,
  :nginx =&gt; &quot;rewrite ^%s /%s permanent;&quot;
}

File.open(&quot;redirects.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) do |f|
  doc.elements.each(&quot;rss/channel/item[wp:status = &#39;publish&#39; and wp:post_type = &#39;post&#39;]&quot;) do |e|
    post = e.elements
    date = DateTime.parse(post[&#39;wp:post_date&#39;].text)
    slug = post[&#39;wp:post_name&#39;].text

    post[&#39;link&#39;].text =~ %r{.*(/archives/\d+)}
    old_url = $1
    new_url = &quot;blog/#{date.strftime(&quot;%Y/%m/%d&quot;)}/#{slug}/&quot;

    f.puts formats[format.intern] % [old_url, new_url]
  end
end
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>The script can generate the necessary directives for Apache or Nginx,
so all you have to do is copy them into your web server
configuration. I also added another redirect rule for the RSS feed to
not annoy my subscribers:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>RewriteRule ^/feed /atom.xml [R=301,L]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Of course I also didn&rsquo;t want to loose all my comments, so I had to
come up with a solution for that. I first
installed the WP <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> plugin and exported all
my current comments. I then used some good old Emacs magic to convert
the list of redirects I had already generated to a CSV for Disqus&#8217;
<a href="http://docs.disqus.com/help/39/">URL map migration tool</a>. So far this
has not migrated all comments to the correct location, but it should
eventually work out (worst case I&rsquo;ll have to email Disqus support).</p>

<p>Last but not least I used Octopress&#8217; excellent
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/index.html">customization suport</a>
to re-add some stuff to my headers, like the OpenID delegate.</p>

<p>Of course there are still some things that need to be done, some of them more urgently
then others. First off this site needs a better stylesheet. The
default is actually quite ok, but I want something with more
personality. I&rsquo;ll also have to go through my old posts and clean them
up a bit, the automatic conversion did some funny things at
times. I also want to re-integrate Flattr and PostRank, but I&rsquo;m not
exactly in a hurry when it comes to that.</p>

<p>I hope this post was useful to some of you, I&rsquo;m definitely happy with
my new blogging setup.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent the first half of this week in Helsinki at the excellent <a href="https://frozenrails.eu/">Frozen Rails</a> conference and thought I&#8217;d share some impressions with you:</p>
<p><strong>Monday:</strong> when we (team <a href="http://tupalo.com">Tupalo</a> that is) finally got to the pre-opening event it was rather empty already, but we managed to collect the leftovers and get a party going that was very fun and helped in getting to know many people quickly. Later that night we picked up a jet lagged Ryan Smith (<a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>) from his hotel and stayed out much longer than we should have&#8230; ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Arriving at Finlandia hall still a bit hungover, I soon got very excited by what I saw around me. The conference is rather small, which in my opinion is one of its strongest points, since it&#8217;s very easy to actually get to talk to a lot of the attendees. The overall atmosphere is very amicable, so you barely ever feel like you are intruding on someone when you strike up a random conversation. Talk-wise it started with Geoffrey Grosenbach&#8217;s (<a href="http://peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a>) <a href="https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#geoffrey">keynote</a>, which was nice but not overly exciting. This was followed by a spontaneous talk by Jeff Kasimir (<a href="http://jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Lab</a>) titled &#8220;The Problem Is In Your Ruby&#8221;, which was absolutely fantastic. I also got a chance to talk to Jeff about potential cooperations with <a href="http://rubylearning.org">RubyLearning</a> later, let&#8217;s see if that gets anywhere. I then took a couple of hours off for some socializing, before watching Jeff&#8217;s second talk <a href="https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#jeff">Blow Up Your Views</a>. The last talk I saw that day was by the <a href="http://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> team and I enjoyed it so much that I immediately switched one of my own projects to Travis. After the conference we had dinner in the excellent <a href="http://www.soulkitchen.fi/">Soul Kitchen</a>, followed by some drinks at <a href="http://www.a21.fi/">A21</a> and <a href="http://www.barloose.com/">Bar Loose</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Despite a lack of sleep I dragged myself to Richard White&#8217;s (<a href="http://uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>) <a href="https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#richard">keynote</a>, who talked about startups and entrepreneurship. That was followed by the very interesting <a href="https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#zach">How GitHub Uses GitHub to Build GitHub</a> by Zach Holman (<a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, surprise). I then spent some time hacking a little on a bit of Ruby code for my lightning talk, but went to see Ryan Smith&#8217;s talk on how stuff works at Heroku. After the coffee break I sat in &#8220;Joseph Ruscio&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="https://silverline.librato.com/">Librato</a>) talk <a href="https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#joseph_ruscio">Implementing a RESTful <span class="caps">API</span> with Ruby the Right Way</a>, but I must admit that I was a bit tired and didn&#8217;t pay as much attention as the talk deserved. The last talk was my personal favorite, <a href="https://frozenrails.eu/sessions#aman">Debugging Ruby Performance</a> by GitHub&#8217;s Aman Gupta (I have some notes as an Emacs org-file <a href="https://github.com/citizen428/study-notes/blob/master/ruby-perfomance/ruby-perfomance.org">on GitHub</a>). The conference ended with some lightning talks, including our own on hack weeks at Tupalo. For dinner Heroku invited some 25 or so people to the expensive <a href="http://www.hotelkamp.fi/">Hotel K&auml;mp</a>, where I spent most of the time talking to Topfunky and his friends. We then went over to <a href="http://www.lebonk.fi/">Le Bonk</a> to join the GitHub drink up, but due to a non-disclosure agreement with myself no details about this evening will be made public ;-)</p>
<p>All in all a very nice and well organized conference, that for me has the perfect size. Congrats and thanks to the team for organizing such an awesome event! <span class="caps">BTW</span>: someone set up a <a href="https://github.com/i0rek/frozenrails-notes">GitHub repository</a> with Frozen Rails slides, photos and notes, check it out!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The awesome folks of <a href="http://5uper.net/">5uper.net</a> are organizing the <a href="http://codedcultures.net/">Coded Cultures</a> festival, an event I highly recommend! Here&#8217;s their press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">CODED</span> <span class="caps">CULTURES</span><br />
<span class="caps">CITY</span> AS <span class="caps">INTERFACE</span><br />
<span class="caps">FESTIVAL</span> 21/09 &#8211; 02/10/2011<br />
<span class="caps">TALKS</span>.<span class="caps">EXHIBITIONS</span>.<span class="caps">WORKSHOPS</span>.</p>
<p>Vom 21. September bis 2. Oktober 2011 wird in Wien das Festival <span class="caps">CODED</span> <span class="caps">CULTURES</span> von der Gruppe 5uper.net veranstaltet. <span class="caps">CODED</span> <span class="caps">CULTURES</span> thematisiert die Schnittstellen von zeitgen&ouml;ssischer Kunst, Medien, neuen Technologien und deren Auswirkungen auf Gesellschaft und Kultur. Im Mittelpunkt stehen europ&auml;ische Positionen einer aktuellen Kunstpraxis, die sich auf Medien und deren (Re-)Konfiguration zwischen urbanem und virtuellem Raum konzentriert.</p>
<p>Im Zeitraum von zwei Wochen wird von &uuml;ber 100 K&uuml;nstlern, Kulturschaffenden und Mitarbeitenden das gr&ouml;&szlig;te Wiener Medienkunstfestival an 13 Locations in Wien pr&auml;sentiert.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CITY</span> AS <span class="caps">INTERFACE</span><br />
Im Jahr 2011 konzentriert sich das Festival mit dem Untertitel &#8220;City as Interface&#8221; auf die Stadt als Austragungsort k&uuml;nstlerischer Interventionen. Dabei wird die Stadt als experimentelles Areal f&uuml;r neue k&uuml;nstlerische Anwendungen gesehen, als Ort an dem k&uuml;nstlerische Prozesse in unterschiedlichsten Formen der Interaktion eingreifen k&ouml;nnen.</p>
<p>K&uuml;nstlergruppen, Kuratoren und Forschende setzen sich mit &ouml;ffentlichem Raum au&szlig;erhalb der &#8220;gesicherten&#8221; Strukturen dezidierter Kunstareale auseinander. Digitale und mediale Kunstproduktionen spielen mit den Bereichen an der Schnittstelle zwischen realen und virtuellen R&auml;umen und vermitteln, wie neue Medientechnologien die Art und Weise unserer Orientierung und die Prozesse unserer Umweltwahrnehmung ver&auml;ndern.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AUS</span> <span class="caps">DEM</span> <span class="caps">PROGRAMM</span><br />
