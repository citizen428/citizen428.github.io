  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, it&#8217;s time for a little update again, so let&#8217;s sum up the last week and a half, shall we?</p>
<p>On Friday the 16th I went to Neusiedl with some friends. We arrived at the camping site in the afternoon and had some drinks before going to watch the football match between the <a href="http://www.wienersportklub.at/web/servlet/Start">Wiener Sportklub</a> and <a href="http://www.scneusiedl.at/">Neusiedl SC</a>. We won that game 2-1 and I can&#8217;t remember when was the last time we celebrated a goal as much as we did celebrate the winning goal in this game. Later on we went to see a concert of Austrian Ska band <a href="http://www.noheadonmyshoulders.com/">No Head on my Shoulders</a> in the surprisingly nice <a href="http://www.bergwerk-neusiedl.at/">Bergwerk Neusiedl</a>. The gig was great, and to my surprise the guy playing the guitar is an old friend of mine whom I haven&#8217;t seen for years. It&#8217;s also worth to note that <a href="http://www.np03.com/">our friends from Tyrol</a> joined us for the weekend, which maybe explains why the partying continued into the wee hours and my memories are a  little vague&#8230; And it&#8217;s probably also the reason why we spent the greater part of Saturday hanging around and doing nothing, except for a little shopping trip to the outlet center in Parndorf. In the evening we then proceeded to watch the game of Wacker Innsbruck (yes, that&#8217;s the way the team should be called) against Mattersburg in terrible rain. I&#8217;ve seen many football games under bad weather conditions, but this match definitely is among the worst, especially given that it ended 0-0.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Currently I don&#8217;t have that much time for Gentoo stuff, so things are going rather slowly on my end of things. At least I managed to do a version bump of <a href="http://ruby-pdf.rubyforge.org/pdf-writer/index.html">pdf-writer</a> and to finally commit the ebuilds for <a href="http://nitrohq.com">Nitro</a> 0.23.0 that were sitting in my overlay for some time now.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ve been a good boy and submitted patches for the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/mysql-upgrading.xml">MySQL upgrade guide</a> and the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-freebsd.xml">Gentoo/FreeBSD documentation</a>. I&#8217;m sure the great folks from the docs team will commit them soon for your reading pleasure. There also was a little update to the unofficial <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~citizen428/doc/gentoo-netbsd.html">Gentoo/NetBSD doc</a>, so now there&#8217;s really no excuse for not helping <a href="http://thunder.netbsd.edu.pl/">Damian</a> anymore.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you haven&#8217;t tried out <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eselect/index.xml">eselect</a> yet, you definitely should do so! Especially if you maintain one of the current foo-config and update-bar tools please consider converting it to an eselect module, to offer our users the benefits of a  consistent and flexible framework, which additionally also has the advantage of fully supporting $<span class="caps">ROOT</span>. Also there&#8217;s good documentation for <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eselect/user-guide.xml">users</a> and <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eselect/dev-guide.xml">developers</a>, so you won&#8217;t have any problems getting started. That said, I&#8217;ve written a replacement for ruby-config that <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~kugelfang/">Danny</a> will commit pretty soon, so expect to see it in the next release of eselect.</p>
<p>There also have been some small updates to the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-freebsd.xml">Gentoo/FreeBSD installation instructions</a>, and thanks to <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~cardoe/">Cardoe&#8217;s</a> input I&#8217;ve already done another patch that soon will be commited by one of our docs team&#8217;s members.</p>
<p>Last but not least I&#8217;ve written up a short guide for migrating from MySQL 4.0.x to 4.1.x which can be found <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~citizen428/mysql-update.txt">here</a>. It&#8217;s just plain text and based on Francesco&#8217;s mail, but he didn&#8217;t want to write something up himself. It was done late yesterday evening when I was really tired, but it&#8217;s better than nothing and we have a link to give out to our users.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As we all know, football is one of the greatest hobbies around! What&#8217;s better than travelling through the whole country &#8211; and sometimes even further &#8211; with your friends, watching games and having a few beers? Or meeting with people to watch a game on TV together? Or travelling to fan tournaments and playing yourself? Not much, that&#8217;s for sure! :)</p>
<p>Alas there is this dark time called off-season, where you have to find another way to satisfy your football addiction. That&#8217;s exactly the time of the year football books have been written for, and in this blog I&#8217;m going to recommend you three of them.</div>
